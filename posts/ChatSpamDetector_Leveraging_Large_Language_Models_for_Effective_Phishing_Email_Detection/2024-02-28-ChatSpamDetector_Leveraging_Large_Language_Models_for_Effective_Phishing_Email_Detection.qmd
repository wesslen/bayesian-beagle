### **Summary:**
- The study introduces ChatSpamDetector, a system that uses large language models (LLMs) to detect phishing emails.
- The system provides detailed reasoning for its phishing determinations, assisting users in making informed decisions about how to handle suspicious emails.
- Evaluation using a comprehensive phishing email dataset confirmed that the system using GPT-4 has superior detection capabilities with an accuracy of 99.70%.

### **Major Findings:**
1. ChatSpamDetector uses large language models (LLMs) to detect phishing emails and provides detailed reasoning for its determinations.
2. The system achieved an accuracy of 99.70% in detecting phishing emails, outperforming other models and baseline systems.
3. LLMs have the capability to extract key indicators from the headers and body of emails, prioritize them, and generate accurate responses, confirming their effectiveness in phishing detection.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The study excluded phishing emails that do not contain links in their body, limiting the scope of the research.
- The default parameters for each LLM were used, but adjusting these parameters could change the results.
- LLMs can enhance their outputs through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by searching for information from external knowledge bases, which could further improve accuracy.

The study introduces a novel system, ChatSpamDetector, that effectively uses large language models to detect phishing emails. The system's high accuracy and detailed reasoning for its determinations make it a valuable tool for users to make informed decisions about handling suspicious emails. However, the study has limitations in the scope of phishing emails analyzed and the parameters used for the large language models. Additionally, the potential for further improvement using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance response accuracy is highlighted. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of large language models in phishing email detection.
