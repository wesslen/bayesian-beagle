### Summary:

- The article proposes a progressive query expansion algorithm called ProQE, which combines classic pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) techniques with large language models (LLMs) to improve retrieval accuracy.
- ProQE is designed to work with both sparse and dense retrieval systems and is compatible with black-box ranking systems.
- The algorithm iteratively expands the query as it retrieves more documents, using LLMs to navigate the relevant expansion-terms space.
- ProQE has a plug-and-play capability, allowing it to integrate seamlessly with any sparse or dense retrieval methods.
- The experimental results on four retrieval datasets show that ProQE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 37% and is the most cost-effective.

### Major Findings:

1. ProQE combines classic PRF techniques with LLMs to improve retrieval accuracy, addressing the limitations of both methods.
2. The algorithm is designed to work with both sparse and dense retrieval systems, making it applicable to a wide range of black-box ranking systems.
3. ProQE achieves an average gain of 37% on MRR and R@1 ranking accuracy compared to the baselines.
4. The algorithm is the cheapest among all other baselines, making it a cost-effective solution for retrieval over cost-constrained data sources.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The article provides a novel solution to the problem of retrieval over cost-constrained data sources, which is a significant contribution to the field.
- The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ProQE in improving retrieval accuracy and cost-effectiveness.
- However, the article does not discuss the limitations or potential biases of the proposed algorithm, which could be a topic for future research.
- Additionally, the article does not provide a detailed comparison of ProQE with other state-of-the-art query expansion methods, which could be useful for evaluating its performance.
- Finally, the article does not discuss the potential applications of ProQE beyond the four retrieval datasets used in the experiments, which could be a topic for future research.
