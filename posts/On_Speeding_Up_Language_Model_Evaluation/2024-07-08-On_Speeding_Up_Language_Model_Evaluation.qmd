# Summary

**Summary:**

The paper addresses the challenge of identifying the best method within a limited budget for evaluating methods on test examples in the context of large language models (LLMs). The authors propose an approach that combines multi-armed bandit algorithms with low-rank factorization to significantly reduce the required resources. The proposed algorithms, UCB-E and UCB-E-LRF, can identify the top-performing method using only 5-15% of the typically needed resources, resulting in an 85-95% reduction in cost.

## Major Findings:

1. The proposed algorithms, UCB-E and UCB-E-LRF, can identify the top-performing method using only 5-15% of the typically needed resources, resulting in an 85-95% reduction in cost.
2. The UCB-E algorithm enjoys a theoretical guarantee that the chance of selecting the best arm converges to 100% by an exponential decay of the number of evaluations.
3. The UCB-E-LRF algorithm leverages the intrinsic low-rankness of the scoring matrices, which can be well-approximated by a low-rank matrix, to predict the remaining unobserved method-example pairs and prioritize evaluations of the pairs with large uncertainties in this prediction.

## Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel approach to reducing the cost of evaluating methods on test examples in the context of LLMs. The proposed algorithms, UCB-E and UCB-E-LRF, offer significant improvements over traditional methods, reducing the required resources by up to 95%. However, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations or biases of the proposed approach, such as the impact of the choice of low-rank factorization or the potential for overfitting to the training data. Additionally, the paper does not provide a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for reducing the cost of evaluating LLMs. Further research is needed to evaluate the proposed approach in a broader context and to address potential limitations and biases.
