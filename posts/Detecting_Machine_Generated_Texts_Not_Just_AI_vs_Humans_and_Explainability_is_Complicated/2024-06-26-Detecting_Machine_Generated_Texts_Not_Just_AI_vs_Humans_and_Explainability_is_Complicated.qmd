# Summary:

The paper "Detecting Machine-Generated Texts: Not Just “AI vs Humans” and Explainability is Complicated" discusses the challenges and limitations of current methods for detecting machine-generated texts. The authors propose a novel ternary text classification scheme that includes an "undecided" category for texts that could be attributed to either human or machine sources. This new category is crucial for understanding how to make the detection result more explainable to lay users. The study involves creating four new datasets and performing binary classification tests to identify the most effective state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection methods and the SOTA LLMs capable of producing harder-to-detect texts. The results highlight the need for detectors to provide clear and understandable explanations to users.

## Major Findings:

1. The study introduces a novel ternary classification system for analyzing texts, adding an "undecided" category to the classification framework. This category recognizes that some texts may simultaneously share characteristics of both machine-generated and human-generated texts.
2. The authors developed a ternary classification dataset and designed experiments to test the validity of this approach. The methodology includes rigorous statistical and model-based analyses and incorporates detailed human evaluations to provide a nuanced understanding of the new ternary text classification task and the complexity of producing human-understandable explanations.
3. The study compares the explanatory power of human assessments with that of automated detectors, highlighting the current explanatory limitations faced by MGT detectors. The results show that the "undecided" category is much needed from the viewpoint of explainability.

## Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a well-structured and coherent summary of the academic article, effectively communicating the essential information. The major findings are clearly highlighted, and the analysis provides a critical evaluation of the article's strengths and weaknesses. However, the critique could be more detailed, addressing specific methodological issues, conflicting evidence, or areas that require further research or clarification. Additionally, the summary could benefit from a more concise and focused presentation of the article's main arguments and contributions.

In summary, the paper provides a valuable overview of the challenges and limitations of current methods for detecting machine-generated texts.
