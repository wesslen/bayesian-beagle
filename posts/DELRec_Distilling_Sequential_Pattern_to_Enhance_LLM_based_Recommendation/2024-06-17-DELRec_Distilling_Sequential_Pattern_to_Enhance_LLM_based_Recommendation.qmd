### Summary:

The paper introduces a novel framework, DELRec, which aims to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in sequential recommendation (SR) tasks. The framework achieves this by extracting behavioral patterns from conventional SR models. DELRec consists of two main components: SR Models Pattern Distilling and LLM-based Sequential Recommendation. The first component focuses on extracting behavioral patterns exhibited by SR models using soft prompts through two well-designed strategies. The second component aims to fine-tune LLMs to effectively use the distilled auxiliary information to perform SR tasks. Extensive experimental results conducted on three real datasets validate the effectiveness of the DELRec framework.

### Major Findings:

1. DELRec outperforms traditional SR models and LLMs-based models in SR tasks, achieving the highest HR@1, HR@5, and NDCG@5 scores.
2. The proposed framework effectively combines the information from conventional SR models with the powerful reasoning capabilities and extensive world knowledge of LLMs to complete more accurate recommendations.
3. The ablation experiments conducted on components within the DELRec framework demonstrate the importance of each component in improving the performance of the framework.
4. The hyperparameter analysis conducted on the proposed DELRec framework shows that the size of soft prompts and the number of recommended items from the SR model have an impact on the overall performance.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the DELRec framework and its components, making it easy to understand the proposed approach.
2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving the performance of LLMs in SR tasks.
3. The ablation experiments conducted on components within the DELRec framework provide valuable insights into the importance of each component in improving the performance of the framework.
4. The hyperparameter analysis conducted on the proposed DELRec framework provides useful information for tuning the framework to achieve optimal performance.
5. The paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed framework, which could be a potential area for future research.
6. The paper does not provide a comparison of the proposed framework with other state-of-the-art LLMs-based SR models, which could be a potential area for future research.
7. The paper does
