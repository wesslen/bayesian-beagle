**Summary:**

The study presents a pipeline for developing an in-house LLM, BURExtract-Llama, to extract clinical information from radiology reports. The method involves using GPT-4 to create a small labeled dataset, then fine-tuning a Llama3-8B model on it. Evaluated on clinician-annotated reports, BURExtract-Llama achieves an average F1 score of 84.6%, which is on par with GPT-4. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing an in-house LLM that matches GPT-4â€™s performance while offering cost reductions and enhanced data privacy.

**Major Findings:**

1. BURExtract-Llama, an in-house LLM, achieves an average F1 score of 84.6% in extracting clinical information from Breast Ultrasound Reports, comparable to GPT-4.
2. The study presents a pipeline for developing an in-house LLM, which involves using GPT-4 to create a small labeled dataset and then fine-tuning a Llama3-8B model on it.
3. The use of an in-house LLM offers cost reductions and enhanced data privacy compared to using proprietary LLMs like GPT-4.

**Analysis and Critique:**

1. The study's reliance on GPT-4 to create a small labeled dataset may introduce biases or errors in the training data, which could impact the performance of BURExtract-Llama.
2. The study does not provide an external validation of BURExtract-Llama, which could limit the generalizability of the findings to other institutions with different writing styles in their radiology reports.
3. The study does not discuss potential limitations or shortcomings of the BURExtract-Llama model, such as its ability to handle ambiguous or incomplete information in radiology reports.
4. The study does not provide a detailed comparison of the performance of BURExtract-Llama with other existing clinical information extraction methods, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses.
5. The study does not discuss the potential impact of the BURExtract-Llama model on clinical
