### **Summary:**
- Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successful in code completion for single source files but struggle with repository-level code completion for large software projects.
- IDECoder is proposed as a framework to leverage Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to enhance LLMs for repository-level code completion.
- IDECoder integrates static contexts and diagnosis results from IDEs to improve the capabilities of LLMs for code completion.

### **Major Findings:**
1. Code LLMs are effective for in-file code completion but struggle with cross-file information for repo-level code completion.
2. IDECoder leverages IDEs to provide cross-file context information and diagnosis results to enhance LLMs for repo-level code completion.
3. Preliminary experiments show that IDECoder outperforms baseline methods in code completion tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- Challenges in identifying cross-file contexts include maintaining accuracy and ensuring relevance, which current methods struggle to address.
- Fusion of cross-file contexts is challenging due to the limited context length of LLMs and the need to prioritize different elements in the contexts.
- IDECoder's integration of static information and diagnosis results from IDEs shows promise, but the closed-source nature of the Pylance plugin limits its full potential.
- Future plans to develop a more mature version of IDECoder and extend it to support a broader range of code-related tasks are promising, but the need for customizable native coding tools from IDE vendors is essential for its success.
