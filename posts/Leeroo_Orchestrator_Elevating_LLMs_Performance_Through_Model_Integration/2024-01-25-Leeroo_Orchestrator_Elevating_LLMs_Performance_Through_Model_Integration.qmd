**Summary:**
The article introduces the Leeroo Orchestrator, an architecture designed to optimize the performance of large language models (LLMs) by integrating multiple trained LLMs. The orchestrator selects the most appropriate expert for each input based on predefined criteria such as speed, cost, and accuracy. Through evaluation on the MMLU benchmark, the results demonstrate that the Leeroo orchestrator achieves performance levels on par with existing models while incurring lower costs. The integration of GPT4 into the underlying model pool further enhances performance, surpassing GPT4's results at a reduced cost. The architecture is designed to continuously learn from and incorporate new expert models, resulting in improved adaptability and performance over time.

### Major Findings:
1. The Leeroo Orchestrator achieves state-of-the-art performance comparable to existing models such as Mixtral, while incurring only two-thirds of its cost. Moreover, integrating GPT4 into the model pool leads to performance levels nearly matching GPT4 at half the cost and even exceeding GPT4's results with a 25% cost reduction.
2. The architecture emphasizes domain-specific expertise, leveraging smaller models for tasks that do not require advanced capabilities. This approach ensures optimal resource utilization without compromising on quality and significantly reduces computational costs.
3. The training methodology of the Leeroo-orch is inspired by self-play in reinforcement learning, enabling the orchestrator to refine its decision-making over time by encountering diverse questions and assimilating feedback from various experts.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article presents a novel approach to leveraging multiple LLMs through the Leeroo Orchestrator, demonstrating promising results in achieving state-of-the-art performance while optimizing costs. However, the evaluation is primarily focused on the comparison with existing models on the MMLU benchmark, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, while the article highlights the potential of the architecture, it could benefit from providing more detailed insights into potential limitations and challenges of the proposed approach. Moreover, the article could address the potential ethical implications of optimizing LLMs for cost-effectiveness and performance, especially in applications where accuracy and reliability are critical. Further research and real-world applications are needed to validate the effectiveness and scalability of the Leeroo Orchestrator in diverse use cases.
