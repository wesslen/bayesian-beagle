### Summary:

- The paper introduces TreeInstruct, an Instructor agent guided by a novel state space-based planning algorithm that asks probing questions to help students independently identify and resolve errors in their code.
- TreeInstruct estimates a student’s conceptual and syntactical knowledge to dynamically construct a question tree based on their responses and current knowledge state, effectively addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently in a multi-turn interaction setting.
- The authors construct a more challenging multi-bug dataset of 150 coding problems, incorrect solutions, and bug fixes, all carefully constructed and annotated by experts.
- Extensive evaluation shows TreeInstruct’s state-of-the-art performance on both datasets, proving it to be a more effective instructor than baselines.
- A real-world case study with five students of varying skill levels further demonstrates TreeInstruct’s ability to guide students to debug their code efficiently with minimal turns and highly Socratic questioning.

### Major Findings:

1. TreeInstruct, an Instructor agent, effectively guides students to debug their code by asking probing questions and estimating their conceptual and syntactical knowledge to construct a question tree.
2. The authors construct a challenging multi-bug dataset of 150 coding problems, incorrect solutions, and bug fixes, all carefully constructed and annotated by experts.
3. Extensive evaluation shows TreeInstruct’s state-of-the-art performance on both datasets, proving it to be a more effective instructor than baselines.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The paper presents a novel approach to code debugging by using an Instructor agent that asks probing questions and estimates a student’s knowledge to construct a question tree.
- The authors construct a challenging multi-bug dataset, which is a significant contribution to the field.
- The extensive evaluation and real-world case study demonstrate the effectiveness of TreeInstruct in guiding students to debug their code efficiently.
- However, the paper does not discuss any potential limitations or shortcomings of the proposed approach, such as the scalability of the method or its applicability to other domains.
- Additionally, the paper does not provide a comparison with other existing methods for code debugging, which could have strengthened the argument for the effectiveness of TreeInstruct
