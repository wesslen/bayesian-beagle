### Summary:

The paper introduces LGR2, a novel HRL framework that leverages language instructions to generate a stationary reward function for the higher-level policy. This approach aims to mitigate non-stationarity in HRL, a recurring issue caused by unstable lower primitive behavior. LGR2 uses language-guided reward, which is unaffected by the lower primitive behavior, to relabel higher-level replay buffer transitions. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of LGR2 through empirical analysis, showing that it effectively alleviates non-stationarity in HRL and achieves success rates exceeding 70 in challenging, sparse-reward robotic navigation and manipulation environments.

### Major Findings:

1. LGR2 is a novel HRL framework that leverages language instructions to generate a stationary reward function for the higher-level policy, mitigating non-stationarity in HRL.
2. The language-guided reward in LGR2 is unaffected by the lower primitive behavior, which helps alleviate non-stationarity.
3. LGR2 effectively alleviates non-stationarity in HRL, as demonstrated through empirical analysis.
4. LGR2 achieves success rates exceeding 70 in challenging, sparse-reward robotic navigation and manipulation environments.
5. LGR2 shows impressive generalization in real-world scenarios, as demonstrated through real-world robotic manipulation experiments.

### Analysis and Critique:

While the paper presents an innovative approach to addressing non-stationarity in HRL, there are some potential limitations and areas for improvement.

1. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of LGR2 with other existing HRL methods, making it difficult to assess its relative performance and advantages.
2. The paper does not discuss the potential limitations of using language instructions to guide the reward function, such as the need for high-quality language data and the potential for ambiguity or misinterpretation.
3. The paper does not explore the potential impact of different language models on the performance of LGR2, which could be an interesting area for future research.
4. The paper does not discuss the potential scalability of LGR2 to more complex tasks or environments, which could be a significant challenge.
5. The
