### Major Findings

1. **Active Research Field:** The research on computational methods for detecting media bias is highly active, with transformer-based classification approaches leading to significant improvements in recent years.

2. **Need for Interdisciplinarity:** There is a lack of interdisciplinarity in existing projects, and there is a need for more awareness of the various types of media bias to support methodologically thorough performance evaluations of media bias detection systems.

3. **Integration of Advancements:** The integration of recent machine learning advancements with reliable and diverse bias assessment strategies from other research areas is seen as the most promising area for future research contributions in the field.

### Summary of Sections

- **Introduction**: Discusses the importance of online news articles and the bias present in news outlets.
- **Media Bias**: Explains media bias and its impact on public perception.
- **Media Bias Taxonomy**: Proposes a unified taxonomy for the media bias domain to mitigate ambiguity around its various concepts and names in prior work.
- **Methodology**: Describes the systematic literature review process, including the retrieval and selection of candidate documents.
- **Related Literature Reviews**: Provides insights into related literature reviews on media bias and critiques their shortcomings.
- **Related Work and Theoretical Embedding**: Presents an overview of media bias and introduces the Media Bias Taxonomy.
- **Computer Science Research on Media Bias**: Categorizes and details the methods used in recent research on media bias detection.

### Critique

The paper provides a valuable contribution to the understanding of media bias taxonomy and computational methods for bias detection. However, it may benefit from addressing the following potential problems:

- The use of a specific range of years for literature review might limit the inclusivity of recent advancements.
- The evaluations of the proposed taxonomy and methods could be further substantiated with empirical results to demonstrate their effectiveness.
- The lack of clarity in defining bias types in the literature and the variations in terminology may raise concerns about the consistency and comparability of the findings.

Overall, the paper presents a comprehensive review and taxonomy of media bias detection research in computer science, offering valuable insights for future advancements in the field.
