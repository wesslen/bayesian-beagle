### Summary:

This study explores language-related functional changes in older adults with Neurocognitive Disorders (NCD) using Large Language Model (LLM)-based fMRI encoding and brain scores. The research aims to address the limitations of existing studies that predominantly focus on healthy, young adults. The findings reveal that higher cognitive abilities correspond to better brain scores, with correlations peaking in the middle temporal gyrus. This study highlights the potential of fMRI encoding models and brain scores for detecting early functional changes in NCD patients.

### Major Findings:

1. The study applies an fMRI encoding model based on LlaMA2 to investigate NCD subjects, generating brain scores to quantify the association between brain areas and language functions.
2. Brain scores for the higher cognitive-level group are consistently better than those of the lower cognitive-level group, and the correlation between brain scores and cognition peaks in the middle temporal gyrus (r = 0.51) and the superior frontal gyrus (r = 0.46).
3. This study provides a feasible direction for further developing interpretable machine-learning models based on language-related fMRI signals for early NCD detection.

### Analysis and Critique:

* The study's primary limitation is the uncertainty surrounding the extent of semantic or syntactic information contained in the embeddings of LlaMA2-Cantonese.
* The brain areas responsible for language processing may also be activated by semantic stimuli generated through vision. In the future, multi-modal semantic information should be comprehensively considered to construct a robust encoding model for understanding the interplay between different modalities and language functions.
* The study could benefit from a larger sample size and a more diverse range of NCD subjects to increase the generalizability of the findings.
* The research could also explore the potential of other LLMs, such as GPT-3 or BERT, for fMRI encoding and brain score analysis in NCD subjects.
* The study does not discuss the potential implications of these findings for clinical practice or the development of targeted interventions for NCD patients. Future research should consider the practical applications of these findings.
