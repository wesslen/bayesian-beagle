### Summary:

The paper introduces CLIMB, a benchmark for evaluating both intrinsic and extrinsic bias in large language models (LLMs) for clinical decision tasks. The authors propose a novel metric, AssocMAD, to assess disparities across multiple demographic groups and use counterfactual intervention to evaluate extrinsic bias in clinical diagnosis prediction. Experiments on popular and medically adapted LLMs from the Mistral and LLaMA families reveal prevalent biased behaviors.

### Major Findings:

1. CLIMB is a pioneering comprehensive benchmark for evaluating intrinsic and extrinsic bias in LLMs for clinical decision tasks.
2. The novel metric AssocMAD is introduced to assess disparities across multiple demographic groups.
3. Counterfactual intervention is used to evaluate extrinsic bias in clinical diagnosis prediction.
4. Experiments on popular and medically adapted LLMs reveal prevalent biased behaviors, with some medically adapted LLMs performing worse than their base counterparts.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper provides a valuable contribution to the field by addressing the need for a thorough bias evaluation in LLMs for clinical applications. The introduction of the CLIMB benchmark and the AssocMAD metric are significant steps towards a more comprehensive evaluation of bias in LLMs. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the limitations and potential biases in the data used for the experiments. Additionally, the authors could explore the potential impact of these biases on real-world clinical applications and discuss strategies for mitigating them.
