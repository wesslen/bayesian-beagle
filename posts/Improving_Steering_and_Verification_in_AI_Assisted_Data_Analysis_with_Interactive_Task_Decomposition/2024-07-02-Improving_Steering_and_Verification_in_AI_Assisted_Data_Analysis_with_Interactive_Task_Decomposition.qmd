**Summary:**

This paper presents a study on the challenges of using AI-assisted data analysis tools, specifically focusing on steering and verification. The study involved 15 participants and identified two significant limitations: steering the AI and verifying its output. The paper then introduces a novel approach to improve steering and verification using editable AI assumptions, progressive disclosure, and non-linear conversations. Two implementations of this approach are presented, each balancing information overload and the degree of user control differently. A controlled, within-subjects experiment was conducted to compare these systems with a Conversational baseline system. The results showed that users reported significantly greater control with the two new systems and found intervention, correction, and verification easier compared to the baseline.

**Major Findings:**

1. The study identified two significant limitations of "conversational" AI tools: steering the AI and verifying its output.
2. A novel approach was developed to improve steering and verification using editable AI assumptions, progressive disclosure, and non-linear conversations.
3. Two systems were implemented based on this approach, each balancing information overload and the degree of user control differently.
4. A controlled, within-subjects experiment was conducted, and users reported significantly greater control with the two new systems and found intervention, correction, and verification easier compared to the baseline.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper presents a well-structured and coherent summary of the study and its findings. The use of markdown for formatting enhances the readability and organization of the information. The study's methodology and results are clearly explained, and the comparison with a Conversational baseline system provides a useful point of reference.

However, there are some potential limitations and areas for improvement. The sample size of 15 participants is relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the study does not provide detailed information on the specific tasks or datasets used, making it difficult to assess the validity and applicability of the results. Furthermore, the paper does not discuss any potential biases or confounding factors that may have influenced the results.

Overall, the paper offers valuable insights into the challenges and potential solutions for improving steering and verification in AI-assisted data analysis. However, further research with larger sample sizes and more diverse tasks
