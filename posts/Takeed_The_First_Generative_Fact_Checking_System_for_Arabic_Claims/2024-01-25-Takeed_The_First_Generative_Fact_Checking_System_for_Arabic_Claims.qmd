### **Summary:**
This article introduces Ta’keed, an explainable Arabic automatic fact-checking system. The system assesses claim truthfulness based on retrieved snippets and utilizes two main components: information retrieval and LLM-based claim verification. The study recommends evaluating using semantic similarities, revealing an average cosine similarity score of 0.76. Additionally, the impact of varying snippet quantities on claim classification accuracy is explored, revealing a potential correlation, with the model using the top seven hits outperforming others with an F1 score of 0.77.

### **Major Findings:**
1. Ta’keed is an explainable Arabic automatic fact-checking system that assesses claim truthfulness based on retrieved snippets.
2. Semantic similarities are recommended for evaluating the system's generated explanations, resulting in an average cosine similarity score of 0.76.
3. The impact of varying snippet quantities on claim classification accuracy is explored, revealing a potential correlation, with the model using the top seven hits outperforming others with an F1 score of 0.77.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
The article presents a comprehensive evaluation of the Ta’keed system, showcasing its effectiveness in providing reasonable classification results with meaningful explanations for claim verification. However, the study identifies mislabeling and insufficient retrieved information as potential challenges. The article also recommends future work to expand the application of the method to diverse datasets containing various languages beyond Arabic and to explore additional details in news articles retrieved from webpages using their respective URLs. Additionally, the study suggests prioritizing semantic evaluations for generated explanations. Overall, the article provides valuable insights into the development and evaluation of an explainable Arabic automatic fact-checking system.
