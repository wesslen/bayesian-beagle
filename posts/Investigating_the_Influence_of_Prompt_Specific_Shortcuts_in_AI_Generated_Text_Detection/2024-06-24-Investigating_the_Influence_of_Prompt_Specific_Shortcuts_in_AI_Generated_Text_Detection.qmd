### Summary:

The paper investigates the impact of prompt-specific shortcuts in AI Generated Text (AIGT) detection. The authors propose Feedback-based Adversarial Instruction List Optimization (FAILOpt), an attack that exploits prompt-specific shortcuts to deceive detectors. The study confirms that AIGT detectors trained on data generated with limited prompts can be unreliable due to their susceptibility to learning prompt-specific shortcuts. The authors demonstrate that FAILOpt can effectively mitigate shortcuts and improve the robustness of detectors.

### Major Findings:

1. The study confirms that AIGT detectors trained on data generated with limited prompts can be unreliable due to their susceptibility to learning prompt-specific shortcuts.
2. The authors propose Feedback-based Adversarial Instruction List Optimization (FAILOpt), an attack that exploits prompt-specific shortcuts to deceive detectors.
3. The study demonstrates that FAILOpt can effectively mitigate shortcuts and improve the robustness of detectors.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper introduces a simple method to improve the robustness of detectors via data augmentation. However, other sources of non-robust features remain not covered in the approach.
2. The study does not suggest a method to improve metric-based detectors. Unlike supervised classifiers, metric-based detectors cannot be adjusted with additional data.
3. The paper reveals weaknesses of existing AIGT detectors, which could potentially encourage abusive uses. However, the authors do not intend to encourage such uses and instead aim to raise concern about the importance of diverse data collection prompts in AIGT detection.
4. The proposed attack, FAILOpt, is provided as a tool to measure the influence of prompt-specific shortcuts and raise concern about this issue to the researcher community.
5. The authors offer a simple, easily applicable defense against input perturbation attacks leveraging FAILOpt, which can prevent the malignant uses of LLMs and contribute to the development of a reliable AIGT detector.
