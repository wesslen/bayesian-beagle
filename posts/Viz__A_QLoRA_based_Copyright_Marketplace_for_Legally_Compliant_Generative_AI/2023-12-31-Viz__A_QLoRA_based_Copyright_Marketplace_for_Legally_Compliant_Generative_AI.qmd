# Viz: A QLoRA-based Copyright Marketplace for Legally Compliant Generative AI

## Key Findings
- **Innovative Integration**: The Viz system integrates Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (QLoRA) within a marketplace framework, revolutionizing the accessibility and efficiency of large language models (LLMs).
- **Addressing Challenges**: By reducing computational overhead, ensuring copyright compliance in training datasets, and creating a sustainable economic model, Viz offers a comprehensive solution to the complex challenges of AI landscape.
- **Legal and Ethical Compliance**: Viz contributes to the discussion on legal and ethical considerations in AI, particularly in copyright compliance and data privacy, providing a holistic and inventive approach to the existing obstacles in the artificial intelligence field.

## Introduction
- The paper aims to introduce the Viz system, which addresses challenges of computational efficiency, legal compliance, and economic sustainability in the utilization and monetization of LLMs.

## Literature Review
- The review outlines the advancements in LLMs, copyright concerns in AI training, and the evolution of fine-tuning techniques, specifically LoRA and QLoRA.

## Viz System Architecture
- The system integrates a marketplace for AI models fine-tuned through QLoRA, providing a legally compliant and economically viable avenue for content creators and users.

## QLoRA Importance in Viz
- QLoRA's core principles and adaptation within Viz significantly reduces computational overhead and enhances model performance.

## Marketplace Design and Economics
- The marketplace employs a dual monetization strategy and revenue sharing models, paralleling existing digital content platforms.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations
