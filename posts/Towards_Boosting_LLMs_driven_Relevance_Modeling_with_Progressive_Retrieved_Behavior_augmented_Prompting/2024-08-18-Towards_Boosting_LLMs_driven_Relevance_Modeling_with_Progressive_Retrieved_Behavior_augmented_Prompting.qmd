### Summary:

The paper proposes a novel framework called Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting (PRBAP) to enhance the relevance modeling capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in search engines. The framework integrates search scenario-oriented knowledge with LLMs by performing user-driven behavior neighbor retrieval from daily search logs and employing advanced prompting techniques to guide LLMs for relevance modeling. The proposed framework has been successfully deployed in an industrial application framework tailored for the deployment of LLMs in relevance modeling.

### Major Findings:

1. The paper introduces a novel framework called PRBAP, which integrates search scenario-oriented knowledge with LLMs to improve their relevance modeling capabilities.
2. The framework performs user-driven behavior neighbor retrieval from daily search logs to obtain domain-specific knowledge in time, retrieving candidates that users consider to meet their expectations.
3. The framework employs advanced prompting techniques that progressively improve the outputs of the LLMs, followed by a progressive aggregation with comprehensive consideration of diverse aspects.
4. The proposed framework has been successfully deployed in an industrial application framework tailored for the deployment of LLMs in relevance modeling.
5. Experiments on real-world industry data and online A/B testing demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves promising performance.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a promising approach to enhancing the relevance modeling capabilities of LLMs in search engines. The proposed framework, PRBAP, integrates search scenario-oriented knowledge with LLMs by performing user-driven behavior neighbor retrieval from daily search logs and employing advanced prompting techniques to guide LLMs for relevance modeling. The framework has been successfully deployed in an industrial application framework tailored for the deployment of LLMs in relevance modeling, and experiments on real-world industry data and online A/B testing demonstrate its promising performance.

However, the paper does not discuss any potential limitations, unanswered questions, or conflicting evidence that may have arisen during the research. It would be beneficial to have a more comprehensive analysis of the proposed framework, including any methodological issues, conflicting evidence, or areas that require further research or clarification. Additionally, the paper does not provide any information on the computational resources required to implement the proposed framework, which would be
