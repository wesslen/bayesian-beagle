### Summary:
- The article discusses the challenges faced by multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) when presented with certain image and text inputs, leading to hallucination.
- The authors propose a benchmark called CorrelationQA to quantify the hallucination level given spurious images and conduct a thorough analysis on 9 mainstream MLLMs.
- The impact of different image formats on the instinctive bias of MLLMs is discussed, along with examples of question-answer (QA) pairs generated using GPT-4.
- Tables showing the accuracy of different MLLMs on CorrelationQA under twelve categories when applied to spurious images are presented.

### Major Findings:
1. Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) universally suffer from an instinctive bias when presented with misleading images.
2. Image formats, particularly typography, significantly influence the instinctive bias of MLLMs, affecting their accuracy and susceptibility to spurious information.
3. GPT-4 demonstrates the ability to generate accurate and diverse responses based on complex prompts, with varying accuracy rates for different categories.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The proposed benchmark and evaluation results contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve the performance and reliability of MLLMs in multi-modal tasks.
- The findings have implications for refining training strategies and improving the modality alignment of MLLMs to mitigate instinctive bias and enhance their performance in real-world scenarios.
- The accuracy results of different MLLMs on spurious images highlight the impact of spurious information on the performance of these models, emphasizing the need for accurate and reliable QA generation.
- The section provides important insights into the performance of MLLMs on CorrelationQA under different conditions, highlighting the impact of spurious images and typography on accuracy, crucial for understanding the robustness and limitations of these models in real-world applications.
