### Summary:
- The Chain-of-Discussion framework aims to improve the quality of open-ended question answering by leveraging the synergy among multiple open-source Large Language Models (LLMs).
- The framework involves two stages: question analysis and evidence analysis, where LLMs interact to provide more correct and comprehensive answers.
- The proposed framework is evaluated on a legal consultation dataset and shows improvements in the quality of responses generated by open-source LLMs.

### Major Findings:
1. The Chain-of-Discussion framework enhances the quality of responses generated by open-source LLMs through multi-model discussions, leading to more correct and comprehensive answers.
2. Involving multiple LLMs in both question analysis and evidence analysis contributes to increasing the probability of LLMs referencing correct evidence, improving the correctness and comprehensiveness of the responses.
3. The framework shows potential to reduce logical errors in responses and improve the ability of LLMs to comprehend and analyze legal articles.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The Chain-of-Discussion framework demonstrates the potential to improve the quality of responses generated by open-source LLMs. However, limitations in the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and their preferences for revising evidence analysis may impact the effectiveness of the framework.
- The framework's reliance on open-source LLMs with around 7B parameters may lead to unreliable output and inferior reasoning capabilities, affecting the overall performance of the Chain-of-Discussion framework.
- The proposed framework shows promise for enhancing the quality of open-ended question answering, but further research is needed to address the limitations and biases associated with open-source LLMs.

Overall, the Chain-of-Discussion framework presents a novel approach to improving the quality of open-ended question answering, but it is essential to address the limitations and biases associated with open-source LLMs to maximize its effectiveness.
