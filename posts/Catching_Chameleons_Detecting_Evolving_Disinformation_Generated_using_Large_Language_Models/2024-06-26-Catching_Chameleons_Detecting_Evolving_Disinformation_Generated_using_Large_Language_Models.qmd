### Summary:

The paper addresses the challenge of detecting evolving disinformation generated by large language models (LLMs). Current detection methods struggle with knowledge retention and performance decline when encountering evolving LLM-generated disinformation. The proposed solution, DELD (Detecting Evolving LLM-generated Disinformation), is a parameter-efficient approach that leverages the general fact-checking capabilities of pre-trained language models and the unique disinformation generation characteristics of various LLMs. DELD sequentially concatenates learned characteristics to facilitate knowledge accumulation and transformation, addressing the issue of label scarcity by integrating semantic embeddings of disinformation with trainable soft prompts. The experiments demonstrate that DELD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and provides valuable insights into the unique patterns of disinformation generation across different LLMs.

### Major Findings:

1. Current detection methods struggle with knowledge retention and performance decline when encountering evolving LLM-generated disinformation.
2. DELD, a parameter-efficient approach, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting evolving LLM-generated disinformation.
3. DELD provides valuable insights into the unique patterns of disinformation generation across different LLMs.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel and effective approach to detecting evolving LLM-generated disinformation. However, there are potential limitations and areas for further research. The study focuses on a specific set of LLMs and may not generalize to other models or domains. Additionally, the evaluation of DELD's performance is based on a limited set of disinformation datasets, and further validation with diverse and larger datasets is needed. The paper also does not address the potential for adversarial attacks on the detection system or the ethical implications of using such a system. Future research should explore these aspects and consider the potential for unintended consequences of deploying a disinformation detection system.
