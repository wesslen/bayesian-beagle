### Summary:
- The article proposes a RElevance-Aware Retrieval-augmented approach for open-domain question answering (QA) to enhance the self-awareness of source relevance for large language models (LLMs).
- The proposed approach includes a new architecture for LLM based RAG system and an improved training method based on bi-granularity relevance fusion and noise-resistant training.
- Experiments on four open-domain QA tasks show that the proposed REAR significantly outperforms previous competitive RAG approaches.

### Major Findings:
1. The proposed REAR approach surpasses all other baselines in coarse-grained relevance binary discrimination and fine-grained document relevance comparison, achieving the best generation performance across the four datasets.
2. REAR achieves superior results compared to RobustLM, which employs the same training data, highlighting the strengths of the architecture and training method.
3. The REAR approach is robust to external retrievers of varied retrieval capacities, demonstrating its effectiveness in perceiving the relevance of external evidence for more suitable utilization.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The proposed REAR approach demonstrates significant improvements in relevance assessment and knowledge utilization for open-domain question answering tasks.
- The article provides a detailed analysis of the impact of retrieved documents and the computational efficiency of the proposed approach.
- The limitations of the study include the need for further evaluation of the proposed methods across a broader spectrum of RAG tasks and the potential for misjudgment in relevance assessment by rerankers.
