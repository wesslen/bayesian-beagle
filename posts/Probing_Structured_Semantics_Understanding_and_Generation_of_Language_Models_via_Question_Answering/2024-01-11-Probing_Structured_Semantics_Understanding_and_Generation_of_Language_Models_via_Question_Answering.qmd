### Summary:

The article evaluates large language models (LLMs) in understanding structured semantics through question answering tasks using formal languages. It introduces probing tasks for formal language understanding and generation, evaluates model performance, and discusses the use of formal languages such as Lambda DCS and SPARQL. The article also outlines the process of generating skeleton candidates, details the probing process, and presents error cases in logical form generation.

### Major Findings:
1. The article introduces a methodology for evaluating LLMs' understanding and generation capabilities in structured semantics using formal languages.
2. The process of generating skeleton candidates and the challenges in entity linking are outlined, setting the stage for evaluating the impact of model scale and the performance of semantic parsers.
3. The examples and experiments demonstrate the application and performance of different models in formal language understanding, providing valuable insights into their capabilities and limitations.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the deep language understanding ability of current LLMs and can guide the development of reasoning approaches. It also highlights the complexities of formal language generation and the importance of structural similarity in selecting examples. However, the error cases in logical form generation demonstrate the need for further refinement and enhancement of language models to minimize errors and improve accuracy. Further research is required to address these limitations and improve the overall performance of LLMs in structured semantics understanding and generation.
