# Summary:

This study investigates how students in an introductory programming class interact with Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, when doing their coursework. The research question is: How do students chat with ChatGPT in the context of introductory programming course assignments? To answer this question, an exercise sheet was developed as part of an introductory programming course at Goethe University in the winter term 2023/24. Students were instructed to solve programming tasks with the assistance of ChatGPT-3.5 and to submit their chat protocols, which is the data basis of this work. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of the chat protocols provides the first insights of its kind into studentsâ€™ authentic interactions with the LLM in a curricular course setting.

# Major Findings:

1. Students engaged differently with ChatGPT in terms of the number of prompts used, their length, and regarding (the content of) follow-up interactions.
2. Three groups of students were identified: (1) students who only used 0-5 prompts, (2) students who used ChatGPT differently, and (3) students who used the GenAI tool most frequently, but for different purposes.
3. The qualitative data analysis revealed a difference in the categorization of problem-solving steps, the identified follow-up interactions, and prompting patterns (Task Description Prompts and Prompts in Own Words).

# Analysis and Critique:

1. The study has a limitation in that it was conducted in a single class at one university, which may not be representative of other educational contexts.
2. The observer's paradox may have influenced students' interactions with the tool, as they were aware of the study.
3. The study provides valuable insights into students' use of ChatGPT and their interaction patterns, which can inform the development of new forms of instructions with the goal of fostering a conscious and critical use.
4. The study highlights the potential of GenAI tools to offer personalized support and feedback to students, but also emphasizes the need for educators to provide the necessary tools and advice on how to use them successfully.
5. The study raises important questions about the role of GenAI tools in the process of educating successful graduates and the competencies required
