# Summary:

TheoremLlama is a framework designed to transform a general-purpose Large Language Model (LLM) into a Lean4 expert. The framework addresses the challenges of formal theorem proving by providing a method for generating NL-FL aligned datasets, training approaches for the LLM formal theorem prover, and techniques for LLM Lean4 proof writing. The key innovation is the NL-FL bootstrapping method, which integrates natural language proofs into Lean4 code for training datasets, leveraging the LLM's NL reasoning ability for formal reasoning. The framework achieves cumulative accuracies of 36.48% and 33.61% on MiniF2F-Valid and Test datasets, respectively, surpassing the GPT-4 baseline.

# Major Findings:

1. TheoremLlama is an end-to-end framework that transforms a general-purpose LLM into a Lean4 expert, addressing the significant data scarcity problem by contributing to the Open Bootstrapped Theorems (OBT) dataset.
2. The major innovation of TheoremLlama is the NL-FL bootstrapping method, which integrates informal proofs into Lean4 code, enhancing the LLM's abilities by using training data to transfer their informal reasoning capabilities to Lean4 proof writing.
3. TheoremLlama achieves 36.48% and 33.61% accuracy rates on MiniF2F-Valid and Test, respectively, largely suppressing the GPT-4 baseline (25.41% and 22.95% separately).

# Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper presents a novel approach to formal theorem proving using LLMs, addressing the data scarcity problem and providing a method for generating NL-FL aligned datasets.
2. The NL-FL bootstrapping method is a significant innovation, leveraging the LLM's NL reasoning ability for formal reasoning.
3. The paper provides extensive experiments and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of TheoremLlama, demonstrating its superior performance compared to the GPT-4 baseline.
4. However, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations of the framework, such as the generalizability of the NL-FL bootstrapping method
