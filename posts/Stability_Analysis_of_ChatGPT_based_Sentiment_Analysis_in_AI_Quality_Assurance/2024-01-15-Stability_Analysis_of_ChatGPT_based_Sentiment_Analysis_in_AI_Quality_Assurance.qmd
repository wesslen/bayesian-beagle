**Summary:**

The paper delves into the quality assurance of a large language model (LLM) – specifically, a ChatGPT-based sentiment analysis system. It discusses the challenges posed by the complex architecture and vast parameters of LLM-based AI products, such as ChatGPT, and emphasizes the importance of AI quality management (AIQM) in ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of such products. The study comprises stability and robustness analyses, focusing on the uncertainty and operational factors, as well as the robustness of the ChatGPT-based sentiment analysis system against four types of perturbations. Experimental analysis using benchmark sentiment analysis datasets reveals uncertainty in the operation of ChatGPT and demonstrates its stability issues in handling conventional attacks.

### Major Findings:
1. **Uncertainty in Operation:** The study identifies uncertainty issues in the running of ChatGPT, attributed to factors such as non-deterministic responses, differences between using ChatGPT on the web and using the ChatGPT API, variance due to timing, and prompt engineering. These operational factors contribute to the instability of the system.

2. **Robustness Analysis:** The paper evaluates the robustness of the ChatGPT-based sentiment analysis system against four types of perturbations – typo, synonym, homoglyph, and homophone. The results demonstrate the system's relatively good robustness against these perturbations, with synonym perturbation posing the strongest attack.

3. **Quality Assurance Conclusions:** The study concludes that the ChatGPT-based sentiment analysis system is robust against adversarial text perturbations, albeit exhibiting uncertainty due to continuous updates, timing differences, and other operational factors.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the stability and robustness of the ChatGPT-based sentiment analysis system. However, it focuses primarily on specific operational and robustness issues without deeply exploring potential solutions or mitigation strategies for the identified problems. Furthermore, while the study offers essential findings for AI quality management, it could benefit from discussing the broader implications of these stability and robustness issues for AI-based products and potential strategies to address them. Additionally, the limitations of the study, such as the specific focus on the ChatGPT-based sentiment analysis system and the need for broader applicability, require further consideration. While the study raises critical points relevant to AIQM, it would benefit from addressing these potential shortcomings and providing a more comprehensive outlook on the topic.
