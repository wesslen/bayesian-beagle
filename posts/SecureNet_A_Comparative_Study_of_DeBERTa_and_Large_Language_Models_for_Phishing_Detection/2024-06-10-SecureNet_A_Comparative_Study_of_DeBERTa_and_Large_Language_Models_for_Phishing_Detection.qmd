# Summary:

- The study compares the performance of DeBERTa V3 and large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini 1.5 in detecting phishing attempts across various communication channels, including email, SMS, URLs, and webpages.
- The HuggingFace phishing dataset and synthetic data generated using GPT-4 were used for training and evaluation.
- DeBERTa V3 emerged as the most effective model, achieving a test dataset recall of 95.17%, closely followed by GPT-4 with a recall of 91.04%.
- The study highlights the importance of dataset diversity and representation in training machine learning models for cybersecurity applications.
- The results demonstrate the potential of advanced language models in strengthening cybersecurity measures for detecting and mitigating phishing threats.

# Major Findings:

1. DeBERTa V3 outperformed LLMs in detecting phishing attempts across various communication channels, achieving a test dataset recall of 95.17%.
2. GPT-4 also demonstrated strong performance, with a recall of 91.04% in detecting phishing attempts.
3. The study emphasizes the importance of dataset diversity and representation in training machine learning models for cybersecurity applications.
4. The results highlight the potential of advanced language models in strengthening cybersecurity measures for detecting and mitigating phishing threats.

# Analysis and Critique:

- The study provides valuable insights into the effectiveness and robustness of DeBERTa V3 and LLMs in detecting phishing attempts.
- However, the study does not discuss the limitations or potential biases of the models, which could be a topic for future research.
- The study also does not provide a detailed comparison of the performance of DeBERTa V3 and LLMs on different types of phishing attempts, such as email, SMS, URLs, and webpages.
- Future research could also explore the potential of combining DeBERTa V3 and LLMs to improve the accuracy and robustness of phishing detection.
- The study could also benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation of the models on real-world phishing datasets, as the synthetic data generated using GPT-4 may not fully capture the complexity and diversity of
