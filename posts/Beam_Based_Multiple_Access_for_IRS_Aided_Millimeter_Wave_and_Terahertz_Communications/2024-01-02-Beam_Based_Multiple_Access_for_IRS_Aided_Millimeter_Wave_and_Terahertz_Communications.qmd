### Main Findings
- The paper proposes a beam-division multiple-access scheme for **intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communications**.
- The proposed scheme combines the advantages of both **orthogonal multiple access** (i.e., no inter-user interference) and **non-orthogonal multiple access** (i.e., full time-frequency resource use), substantially boosting system capacity.
- Monte Carlo simulations corroborate that the proposed beam-division multiple access (BDMA) scheme outperforms frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), time-division multiple access (TDMA), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in terms of system capacity.

### I Introduction
- **Challenges of mmWave and THz signals**: These signals suffer from high path loss, atmospheric absorption, and weather attenuation, leading to short transmission distances.
- **Hybrid beamforming as a solution**: The paper introduces the concept of hybrid beamforming to address these challenges, which uses a few radio frequency chains and a phase-shifter network to achieve high performance with lower hardware complexity.

### II System Model
- **Overview of system components**: The system consists of a base station, users, and an IRS, with a hybrid digital-analog antenna array and multiple sub-arrays used for beamforming.

### III Beam-Division Multiple Access
- **Proposal of a hierarchical frame structure**: The proposed hierarchical frame structure facilitates angle measurement, user categorizing, grouping, and time shifting for highly flexible multiple access.
- **User categorizing and grouping**: Users are classified into near users and far users and are further divided into time slots to maximize spatial-division access.

### IV Optimization Design of BDMA
- **Reflected and direct beam optimization**: The paper discusses the optimization of reflected and direct beams towards the IRS and the base station, respectively, to maximize spectral efficiency.

### V Numerical Results
- **Simulation setup and performance comparison**: The paper presents detailed simulation results comparing the performance of different multiple-access techniques, showing that the proposed BDMA scheme outperforms other methods in terms of sum spectral efficiency.

### VI Conclusions
- **Importance of the proposed scheme**: The proposed BDMA scheme substantially improves the capacity of an IRS-aided mmWave and THz system, as verified by Monte Carlo simulations.


### Critique
The paper provides a comprehensive and detailed exploration of the proposed BDMA scheme for IRS-aided mmWave and THz communications. However, the theoretical aspects and simulation results could be further supported by real-world experimental data to validate the practical feasibility and performance of the proposed scheme. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion on potential implementation challenges and scalability issues of the proposed scheme in real-world deployment scenarios.
