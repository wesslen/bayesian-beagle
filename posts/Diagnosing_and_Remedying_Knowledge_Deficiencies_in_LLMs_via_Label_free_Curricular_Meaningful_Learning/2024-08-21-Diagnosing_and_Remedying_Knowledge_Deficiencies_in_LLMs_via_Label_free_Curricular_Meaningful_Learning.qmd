### Summary:

The paper presents a novel framework called LaMer (label-free curricular meaningful learning) to diagnose and remedy knowledge deficiencies in large language models (LLMs) without relying on labeled data. The framework utilizes relative entropy to automatically diagnose and quantify the knowledge deficiencies in LLMs, and then applies curricular meaningful learning to efficiently and effectively remedy the deficiencies. The proposed method is evaluated on 4 open-source LLMs and 7 out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning and language understanding benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the performance of LLMs.

### Major Findings:

1. The LaMer framework can efficiently and effectively diagnose and remedy knowledge deficiencies in LLMs, improving their performance across various OOD reasoning and language understanding benchmarks.
2. LaMer achieves comparable results to baselines with just 40% training data and even surpasses methods that rely on labeled datasets for deficiency diagnosis.
3. The proposed method can offer an effective knowledge deficiency diagnostic tool for efficient LLM development, making it a valuable contribution to the field.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper presents a well-structured and coherent summary of the proposed method, providing a clear overview of its components and their roles in diagnosing and remedying knowledge deficiencies in LLMs.
2. The use of relative entropy to diagnose knowledge deficiencies is a novel approach that addresses the challenge of evaluating LLMs with limited labeled samples. However, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations or biases of this method, which could be a topic for future research.
3. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of LaMer with other existing methods for diagnosing and remedying knowledge deficiencies in LLMs. While the results demonstrate the effectiveness of LaMer, a more comprehensive comparison with other methods would provide a better understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.
4. The paper does not discuss the potential applications of LaMer beyond improving the performance of LLMs. For example, the proposed method could be used to identify and address biases in LLMs, which is an important issue in the field of natural language processing.

Overall, the paper presents a promising approach to diagnosing and remedying knowledge deficiencies in LL
