### **Summary:**
- The study investigates GPT-4's assessment of its performance in healthcare applications using a simple prompting technique to prompt the model with questions from the USMLE questionnaire.
- Results indicate that feedback influences relative confidence but doesn't consistently increase or decrease it.
- The study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the reliability of AI, particularly of LLMs like GPT-4, within healthcare, offering insights into how feedback mechanisms might be optimized to enhance AI-assisted medical education and decision support.

### **Major Findings:**
1. GPT-4's confidence levels significantly rose when providing accurate responses, but also increased in certain cases when delivering incorrect answers.
2. The model exhibited reduced confidence, even when delivering correct answers, especially in scenarios where feedback was incorporated.
3. Feedback influences relative confidence but doesn't consistently increase or decrease it.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The study's findings suggest that feedback influences the model's confidence levels, but the impact on average confidence values is not enhanced.
- The model consistently maintains certain confidence levels, regardless of feedback or the correctness of responses.
- Future research should focus on increasing the study's sample size and conducting comparative analyses with other models to comprehensively investigate how feedback influences AI's effectiveness in clinical decision-making.
