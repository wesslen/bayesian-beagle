Summary:

The paper introduces ODYSSEY, a new framework that empowers Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with open-world skills to explore the vast Minecraft world. ODYSSEY comprises three key parts: (1) An interactive agent with an open-world skill library that consists of 40 primitive skills and 183 compositional skills. (2) A fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model trained on a large question-answering dataset with 390k+ instruction entries derived from the Minecraft Wiki. (3) A new open-world benchmark includes thousands of long-term planning tasks, tens of dynamic-immediate planning tasks, and one autonomous exploration task.

Major Findings:

1. The proposed ODYSSEY framework can effectively evaluate the planning and exploration capabilities of agents.
2. The open-world skill library improves the efficiency of agents in Minecraft, surpassing previous studies in terms of success rate and time efficiency.
3. The fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model outperforms the original LLaMA-3 model in terms of success rate and time efficiency, albeit at the cost of more LLM iterations.
4. The multi-round planning strategy significantly improves the time efficiency of the agent, enabling it to iteratively optimize its plan based on the outcomes of previous battles.

Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a comprehensive framework for developing and evaluating autonomous embodied agents in open-world environments. The use of LLMs in Minecraft has been explored in previous works, but the proposed ODYSSEY framework provides a more stable and efficient method for generating complex policies for broader exploration and more complex tasks. However, the use of open-source LLMs is prone to generating hallucinations, which can decrease agent performance. The authors plan to address this issue by employing retrieval-augmented generation to improve LLMs in Minecraft. Additionally, the skill library is still text-based, which limits its functionality in tasks requiring visual information. The authors plan to integrate visual processing capabilities into the skill library to expand its capabilities.

The paper also introduces a new open-world benchmark that encompasses tasks requiring long-term planning, dynamic-
