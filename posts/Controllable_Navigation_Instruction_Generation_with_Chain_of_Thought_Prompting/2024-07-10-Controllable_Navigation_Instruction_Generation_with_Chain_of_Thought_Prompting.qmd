### Summary:

The paper introduces C-Instructor, a model that utilizes the chain-of-thought-style prompt for style-controllable and content-controllable instruction generation. C-Instructor employs a Chain of Thought with Landmarks (CoTL) mechanism to guide the LLM in identifying key landmarks and generating complete instructions. This approach renders generated instructions more accessible and offers greater controllability over the manipulation of landmark objects. Additionally, C-Instructor presents a Spatial Topology Modeling Task to facilitate the understanding of the spatial structure of the environment. A Style-Mixed Training policy is also introduced, leveraging the prior knowledge of LLMs to enable style control for instruction generation based on different prompts within a single model instance.

### Major Findings:

1. C-Instructor significantly outperforms previous instruction generation methods across different linguistic metrics on four indoor/outdoor benchmarks.
2. The model proves to be an effective means of data augmentation for VLN training over previous speaker models.
3. Instructions generated by C-Instructor demonstrate enhanced navigation guidance capabilities in both instruction following model experiments and human evaluations.

### Analysis and Critique:

While C-Instructor shows promising results in generating style-controllable and content-controllable instructions, there are some potential limitations and areas for improvement.

1. The model's reliance on LLMs may limit its ability to generate instructions in specific domains where LLMs have not been extensively trained.
2. The CoTL mechanism assumes that landmarks are always available and well-defined, which may not be the case in all environments or scenarios.
3. The Spatial Topology Modeling Task could be further improved by incorporating more advanced spatial reasoning techniques.
4. The Style-Mixed Training policy may not fully capture the nuances of different instruction styles, as it relies on prompts to differentiate between styles.

In conclusion, C-Instructor is a valuable contribution to the field of instruction generation, offering a novel approach to generating style-controllable and content-controllable instructions. However, further research is needed to address the potential limitations and improve the model's performance in specific domains and scenarios.
