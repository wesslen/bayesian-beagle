### **Summary:**
- Preference learning with large language models (LLMs) aims to align the LLMs' generations with human preferences.
- Out-of-distribution (OOD) preference learning is challenging due to the difficulty of obtaining human feedback for every encountered distribution.
- This work addresses OOD PL by optimizing a general reward model through a meta-learning approach.

### **Major Findings:**
1. Aligning LLMs with human preferences through reinforcement learning has been demonstrated as a practical approach.
2. Most previous work on reinforcement learning from human feedback focuses on in-distribution preference learning.
3. An end-to-end strategy to learn a reward function capable of guiding policy optimization for OOD preference learning is proposed.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The article provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges and potential solutions for OOD preference learning.
- The theoretical convergence rate of the bilevel optimization algorithm is established under reasonable assumptions.
- Empirical experiments on controlled sentiment generation and knowledge answer generation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for OOD preference learning.
