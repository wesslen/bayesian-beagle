### **Summary:**
- Large language models (LLMs) are crucial for building communicative AI but face challenges in efficient customization.
- Recent studies have focused on model editing to manipulate specific memories of language models and change language generation.
- The robustness of model editing remains an open question, and this work seeks to understand the strengths and limitations of editing methods.

### **Major Findings:**
1. Edited LLMs behave inconsistently in realistic situations, experiencing confusion and hallucination in the neighborhood intersections of knowledge.
2. Rephrased prompts lead LLMs to deviate from the edited knowledge memory, resulting in a significant decline in performance.
3. More popular knowledge is memorized better, easier to recall, and harder to robustly edit.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- Existing editing methods show promising performance but are vulnerable to attacks, indicating a substantial disparity between existing methods and practical application.
- The performance of editing experiences a significant decline on rephrased prompts that are complex and flexible but common in realistic applications.
- Knowledge that is more popular is memorized better, easier to recall, and harder to robustly edit, indicating potential limitations in editing less popular knowledge.
