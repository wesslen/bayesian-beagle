**Summary:**

The paper introduces a novel alignment strategy called Weight Averaged Rewarded Policies (WARP) for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feeduring (RLHF) in large language models (LLMs). WARP aims to optimize the -reward Pareto front of solutions by merging policies in the weight space at three distinct stages: using the exponential moving average (EMA) of the policy as a dynamic anchor in regularization, applying spherical interpolation to merge independently fine-tuned policies, and linearly interpolating between the merged model and the initialization. The iterative application of WARP improves the -reward Pareto front, aligning the LLMs while protecting the knowledge from pre-training. The paper compares WARP with state-of-the-art baselines and shows that it outperforms them in terms of alignment and quality.

**Major Findings:**

1. WARP improves the quality and alignment of Gemma policies, outperforming other open-source LLMs.
2. The use of EMA as a dynamic anchor in regularization allows for a gradual automatic annealing and relaxation of the regularization, leading to higher rewards.
3. The application of spherical interpolation to merge independently fine-tuned policies improves generalization and reduces memorization.
4. The linear interpolation towards the initialization enables the recovery of features from pre-training and improves the -reward Pareto front.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper presents a novel and promising approach to RLHF in LLMs. The use of model merging by weight averaging is a well-established technique in the literature, and the paper builds on this to propose a new alignment strategy. The experimental results show that WARP outperforms other RL alignment strategies in terms of -reward Pareto optimality. However, the paper does not discuss the computational cost of training WARP, which may be a limitation for some applications. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other RLHF methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
