# Summary

The paper introduces McEval, a massively multilingual code evaluation benchmark covering 40 programming languages with 16K test samples. The benchmark includes challenging code completion, understanding, and generation evaluation tasks with finely curated multilingual instruction corpora McEval-Instruct. The authors also introduce an effective multilingual coder mCoder trained on McEval-Instruct to support multilingual programming language generation.

## Major Findings

1. McEval is the first massively multilingual code evaluation benchmark, covering 40 programming languages with 16K test samples.
2. The benchmark includes challenging code completion, understanding, and generation evaluation tasks with finely curated multilingual instruction corpora McEval-Instruct.
3. The authors introduce an effective multilingual coder mCoder trained on McEval-Instruct to support multilingual programming language generation.

## Analysis and Critique

1. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of McEval with existing benchmarks, making it difficult to assess its advantages and limitations.
2. The paper does not discuss the potential biases in the data used for training mCoder, which could impact its performance on certain tasks or languages.
3. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the performance of mCoder on different tasks and languages, making it difficult to assess its strengths and weaknesses.
4. The paper does not discuss the potential applications of McEval and mCoder in real-world software development scenarios.
5. The paper does not discuss the potential ethical implications of using mCoder for code generation, such as the risk of generating code that violates software licenses or copyright laws.
