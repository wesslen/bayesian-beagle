### Summary:

This paper conducts an extensive and comprehensive investigation into two types of state-of-the-art learning-based approaches for vulnerability detection: sequence-based and graph-based models. The study aims to understand these models better and provide lessons and guidelines for practical usage. The research focuses on graph-based and sequence-based vulnerability detection models at function granularity and addresses the limitations of previous studies, such as inconsistent conclusions, lack of large language model (LLM) studies, and neglect of impacts on users.

The study is based on seven research questions grouped into five important dimensions: model capabilities, model interpretation, model stability, ease of use, and model economy. The main contributions of the work include an extensive comparison among learning-based approaches, the design of seven RQs for comprehensive understanding, and the release of a reproduction package for further study.

### Major Findings:

1. Sequence-based models outperform graph-based models in terms of all evaluated metrics, indicating that complex code structure may not be necessary for vulnerability detection using deep learning techniques.
2. Sequence-based models have complementary abilities to detect vulnerabilities, with LineVul performing better in terms of Accuracy, Precision, and F1-score, while SVulD performs better in terms of Recall.
3. ChatGPT's performance is far from the existing SOTA baselines, especially in terms of Recall, Accuracy, and F1-score, suggesting that it is not yet competent for vulnerability detection tasks.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of learning-based models for vulnerability detection, addressing various aspects such as model capabilities, interpretation, stability, ease of use, and economy. However, the study has some limitations:

1. The comparison between ChatGPT and existing models is based on a statistically sampled dataset, which may not fully represent the entire dataset.
2. The study does not consider the impact of different prompt settings on ChatGPT's performance, which could affect the results.
3. The analysis of the types of vulnerabilities that each learning-based approach is skilled in is based on the Top-10 vulnerability types that are most correctly classified for each method, which may not be representative of the entire dataset.
