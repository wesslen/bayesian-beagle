**Summary:**

This paper reviews the knowledge mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes a novel taxonomy across the entire life cycle of LLMs. The taxonomy encompasses knowledge utilization at a specific time and knowledge evolution across all periods of LLMs. The paper introduces preliminaries of this field and reviews knowledge utilization mechanisms from a new perspective. It also delves into the fundamental principles for knowledge evolution and discusses challenges of knowledge utilization, and posits some promising hypotheses to explore potential avenues for developing powerful and trustworthy models. The paper also provides some future directions and tools for knowledge mechanism analysis.

**Major Findings:**

1. The paper pioneeringly reviews the mechanism across the whole knowledge life cycle and proposes a novel taxonomy for knowledge mechanisms in LLMs.
2. The paper introduces a new perspective to analyze knowledge utilization mechanisms from three levels: memorization, comprehension and application, and creation.
3. The paper discusses knowledge evolution in individual and group LLMs, and analyzes the inherent conflicts and integration in this process.
4. The paper suspects that the prevalent transformer architecture may impede creativity, data distribution and quantity may contribute to the fragility of parametric knowledge, leading to hallucinations and knowledge conflict. Besides, dark knowledge will exist for a long time.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper provides a comprehensive review of the knowledge mechanisms in LLMs and proposes a novel taxonomy for knowledge mechanisms in LLMs. The paper introduces a new perspective to analyze knowledge utilization mechanisms from three levels: memorization, comprehension and application, and creation. The paper also discusses knowledge evolution in individual and group LLMs, and analyzes the inherent conflicts and integration in this process. However, the paper does not provide empirical evidence to support its hypotheses and does not discuss the limitations of its proposed taxonomy. The paper also does not discuss the ethical implications of its proposed taxonomy.
