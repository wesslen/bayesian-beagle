### **Summary:**
- The paper introduces post-training approaches for task-agnostic and task-specific expert pruning and skipping of MoE LLMs to improve deployment efficiency while maintaining model performance.
- The proposed methods reduce model sizes and increase inference speed while maintaining satisfactory performance across a wide range of tasks.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The introduction of post-training expert pruning and dynamic skipping methods significantly reduces memory usage and enhances inference speed while maintaining high model performance.
2. The proposed expert pruning method outperforms weight pruning algorithms in terms of memory usage and benchmark performance.
3. Using domain-specific calibration datasets for expert pruning significantly improves performance on domain-specific tasks.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The paper provides innovative methods for expert-level model sparsification, but the expert pruning method may become cumbersome with a large number of experts in each MoE layer.
- The proposed methods are evaluated on the Mixtral 8x7B and Mixtral 8x7B Instruct models, limiting the generalizability and scalability of the findings.
- The authors acknowledge the ethical implications of deploying large language models and commit to making their code available for transparency.

Overall, the paper presents promising methods for improving the deployment efficiency of MoE LLMs, but further research is needed to address limitations and ensure generalizability.
