### Major Takeaways

1. **On-Device Recommender Systems (ODRSs)** have emerged as a new paradigm to address the challenges faced by traditional cloud-based recommender systems, such as resource-intensive computation, reliance on network access, and privacy breaches.
   
2. ODRSs leverage the computational capacity of user devices with lightweight recommendation models tailored for resource-constrained environments, enabling real-time inference with usersâ€™ local data. They are optimized for on-device deployment and inference, on-device training, and privacy/security mechanisms.

3. The tutorial aims to introduce methodologies of ODRSs, provide a comprehensive taxonomy of ODRSs, and discuss the limitations and future directions of ODRSs to lay the foundation for follow-up research and applications concerning this new recommendation paradigm.

### Introduction

The tutorial introduces the emergence of **On Device Recommender Systems (ODRSs)** as a new paradigm in response to the challenges faced by traditional cloud-based recommender systems. The tutorial aims to systematically introduce methodologies of ODRSs, including an overview of existing research, a comprehensive taxonomy of ODRSs, and the limitations and future directions of ODRSs.

### Relevance to the Web Conference

The tutorial is relevant in the context of the Web Conference, where recommender systems have gained significant attention. With a substantial interest in the field of recommender systems, the conference provides an ideal platform to disseminate fundamental knowledge, promote recent research outcomes, and foster collaborative efforts to enhance ODRSs.

### Tutorial Content and Schedule

The tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive and current picture of ODRSs, enable a structured understanding of the various methods involved, and outline potential future research directions in the ODRS. The content is planned for 3 hours and consists of five sections covering various aspects of ODRSs, from welcome and introduction to open discussions.

### Critique

The paper presents a detailed and comprehensive overview of On-Device Recommender Systems (ODRSs) and their relevance in the context of contemporary e-commerce applications. However, the information provided is highly technical and may require a significant background in recommendation systems and related fields for full comprehension. Additionally, while the tutorial aims to lay the foundation and spark new insights for follow-up research and applications concerning ODRSs, it would benefit from more practical examples or case studies to illustrate the real-world implications of ODRSs.
