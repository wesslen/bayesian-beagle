### **Summary:**
The article introduces AutoPRM, a self-supervised framework that automates procedural supervision for multi-step reasoning tasks in large language models (LLMs). AutoPRM efficiently enhances the fine-tuning of LLMs for intricate reasoning challenges by decomposing complex problems into more manageable subquestions and sequentially applying reinforcement learning to iteratively improve the subquestion solver. The framework significantly improves performance on mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and can be easily integrated with other orthogonal reasoning pipelines.

### Major Findings:
1. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in multi-step reasoning tasks, yet their reliance on extensive manual labeling to provide procedural feedback remains a significant impediment.
2. AutoPRM significantly improves performance on mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks over SOTA methods.
3. AutoPRM can be easily integrated with other orthogonal reasoning pipelines.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges in multi-step reasoning tasks and introduces a novel self-supervised framework, AutoPRM, to address these challenges.
- The framework's ability to decompose complex problems into manageable subquestions and apply reinforcement learning to iteratively improve the subquestion solver is a significant advancement in the field of reasoning tasks.
- The article's critical analysis highlights the limitations of existing methods and the potential of AutoPRM to overcome these limitations through its innovative approach to automating procedural supervision for multi-step reasoning tasks.
- The framework's integration with other reasoning pipelines and its potential for further research and development make it a valuable contribution to the field of natural language processing and reasoning tasks.
