1. **Rigid transformation & Cropping**
   - `rotate90`, `rotate180`, `rotate270`: Rotate the grid by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
   - `flipVertical`, `flipHorizontal`: Flip the grid vertically or horizontally.
   - `transpose`: Transpose the grid.
   - `crop`: Crop the grid to a specified size.
   - `uncrop`: Uncrop the grid to a specified size.

2. **Composition**
   - `stack`: Stack grids in a specified order.
   - `compose`: Compose two grids.
   - `map`: Apply a function to each cell in the grid.
   - `filter`: Filter cells in the grid based on a condition.

3. **Object manipulation**
   - `select`: Select objects based on specific attributes.
   - `split`: Split the grid into subgrids.
   - `merge`: Merge subgrids into a single grid.

4. **Colour manipulation**
   - `eraseColor`: Erase a specific colour from the grid.
   - `fillColor`: Fill the grid with a specific colour.
   - `remapColor`: Remap colours in the grid.

5. **Morphology**
   - `border`: Draw a border around objects in the grid.
   - `fillHoles`: Fill holes inside objects in the grid.
   - `compress`: Compress blank spaces in the grid.

6. **Counting**
   - `count`: Count the number of objects in the grid.
   - `countColor`: Count the number of cells with a specific colour.
