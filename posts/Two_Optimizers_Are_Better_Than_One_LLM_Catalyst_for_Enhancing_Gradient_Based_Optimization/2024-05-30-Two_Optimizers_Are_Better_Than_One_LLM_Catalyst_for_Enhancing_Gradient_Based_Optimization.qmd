### Summary:

The paper proposes a combined optimization method that leverages both the local carefulness of gradient-based optimizers and the flexible semantics exploration of LLM-based optimizers. The method is instantiated in a prompt tuning scenario and tested on prompt tuning tasks, achieving consistent improvements over existing prompt tuning methods. The proposed method combines the deductive LLM-based optimizer in unconstrained vocabulary space with the disciplined gradient-based optimizer in the parameter space for better optimization performance.

### Major Findings:

1. The proposed combined optimization method leverages both the locally rigorous gradient-based optimizer and the high-level deductive LLM-based optimizer, consistently yielding improvements over competitive baseline prompt tuning methods.
2. The method addresses the limitations of gradient-based optimization, such as entrapment in local optima, by leveraging the inductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
3. The method introduces a higher-level guidance for optimization that effectively utilizes task descriptions and real-time optimization trajectories.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the proposed method with other optimization methods, such as evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning.
2. The paper does not discuss the potential limitations of using LLMs as optimizers, such as the high computational cost and the need for large-scale pre-training.
3. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the impact of the number of rounds and the training iterations of the gradient optimizer on the performance of the proposed method.
4. The paper does not discuss the potential applications of the proposed method to other optimization problems, such as adapters or LoRA.
5. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the impact of the choice of LLM on the performance of the proposed method.
6. The paper does not discuss the potential biases and limitations of the proposed method, such as the potential for overfitting or the need for large-scale pre-training.
7. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the impact of the choice of prompt length on the performance of the proposed method.
8. The paper does not discuss the potential limitations of using the proposed method for adapter-based fine-tuning methods.
