### Summary:

The paper introduces a novel approach called PrOmpting with Episodic Memory (POEM) for optimizing prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs). POEM is a memory-based method that optimizes the order of In-Context Learning (ICL) examples within LLM prompts. It utilizes an episodic memory to store the performance of any combination of training data and ICL orderings, which serves as a non-parametric nearest-neighbors model during testing. The method is designed to be efficient and reliable, avoiding exhaustive searches across all data-ICL order combinations.

### Major Findings:

1. POEM outperforms recent techniques like TEMPERA and RLPrompt by over 5.3% in various text classification tasks.
2. The method adapts well to broader language understanding tasks, consistently outperforming conventional heuristic methods for ordering examples.
3. POEM utilizes a similarity ranking to encode example orders based on their proximity to the test instance.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other memory-based methods for prompt optimization.
2. The method's performance on tasks requiring larger LLMs, such as Commonsense Reasoning and Question Answering, is not thoroughly evaluated.
3. The paper does not discuss the potential limitations of the method, such as its dependence on the quality of the episodic memory and the potential for overfitting to the training data.
4. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the method, which is an important consideration for practical applications.
5. The paper does not discuss the potential for using POEM in conjunction with other prompt optimization techniques, such as gradient-based methods or heuristic methods.
6. The paper does not discuss the potential for using POEM in a continual learning setting, where the model is continually updated with new data.
7. The paper does not discuss the potential for using POEM in a multi-task learning setting, where the model is trained on multiple tasks simultaneously.
8. The paper does not discuss the potential for using POEM in a transfer learning setting, where the model is trained on one task and then fine-tuned on another task.
