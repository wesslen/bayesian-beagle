### Summary

- **Long-context Large Language Models (LCLMs)** have gained significant interest, but their potential is limited by inadequate context utilization.
- The paper introduces **Structured Packing for Long Context (SPLiCe)**, a method for creating training examples by using a retrieval method to collate the most mutually relevant documents into a single training context.
- Empirical validation of SPLiCe on medium-scale and large-scale models demonstrates improvements in perplexity, long-context performance, in-context learning ability, and retrieval performance.

### Introduction

- LCLMs have transformed AI and natural language processing, but issues with context utilization hinder their performance.
- The paper focuses on improving context utilization in LCLMs by structuring training examples to benefit from long context.

### Method

- SPLiCe constructs training examples by retrieving related documents and linearizing the structure to form long-context examples.
- Baseline methods involve randomly sampling documents for training examples, or organizing them based on repository-level structure.
- The paper compares SPLiCe against baseline and repository-level packing methods and evaluates its performance on different types of data.

### Experiments with medium-scale models

- SPLiCe outperforms the Baseline and repository-level code packing methods, demonstrating its broader applicability to non-code data.
- SPLiCe not only improves perplexity on long-context evaluation but also enhances in-context learning ability and retrieval performance.

### Large-scale models

- SPLiCe is shown to improve the long-context performance, in-context learning, question-answering abilities, and information retrieval capabilities of large-scale language models.

### Related work

- The paper addresses improving training examples for language models and highlights the differences and advantages of SPLiCe over previous approaches.

### Limitations and future work

- The paper acknowledges the need for future research on the choice of retriever, granularity of training examples, scaling properties, and integration with other training methods, among others.

### Conclusions

- SPLiCe is proposed as a novel method for improving long-context language models' performance by structuring training data in a manner that enhances context utilization. The paper suggests multiple interesting research directions for improving the performance of long-context language models.

### Reproducibility

- The paper provides details about data preparation, model architecture, and source code to ensure the reproducibility of its results.

### Critique

The paper provides a comprehensive explanation of SPLiCe and its application in improving long-context language models. However, it could benefit from more detailed comparisons with existing methods and a more comprehensive discussion on potential limitations and challenges. Also, while the paper mentions future work, it could provide more specific suggestions for future research directions. Additionally, a more thorough discussion of potential risks and ethical considerations related to improving language models would strengthen the paper's contribution.
