# Summary:

The paper explores the feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) for conducting cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The authors collected real CBT corpus from online video websites and designed an automatic evaluation framework involving the evaluation of emotion tendency, structured dialogue pattern, and proactive inquiry ability. Four LLMs with excellent performance on natural language processing were evaluated, and the results showed the great potential of LLMs in psychological counseling, especially after combining with other technological means.

## Major Findings:

1. The study found that LLMs can generate CBT dialogue text with high text diversity, semantic similarity, and text fluency. The models also demonstrated active questioning ability, which is crucial in CBT.
2. The integration of a CBT knowledge base with LLMs can enhance the models' CBT counseling ability. The experimental results showed that the integrated models could generate more concise and realistic dialogue text, which is more in line with the dialogue style and pattern of a psychotherapist and a patient in real-life scenarios.
3. The study also highlighted some limitations of the experiment, such as the limited number of CBT dialogues collected and the limited knowledge base, which may not cover comprehensive knowledge of CBT. Additionally, CBT based on LLM involves the patient's privacy and personal information, which may pose privacy and security risks.

## Analysis and Critique:

The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the CBT counseling ability of LLMs, which includes the evaluation of emotion tendency, structured dialogue pattern, and proactive inquiry ability. The study also explores the potential of integrating a CBT knowledge base with LLMs to enhance their CBT counseling ability. However, the paper has some limitations, such as the limited number of CBT dialogues collected and the limited knowledge base, which may not cover comprehensive knowledge of CBT. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the ethical and privacy concerns related to CBT based on LLMs. It is essential to address these concerns to ensure the safe and effective use of LLMs in psychological counseling.
