### Summary:

- The paper explores the advantages of representing and processing semantic knowledge extracted into graphs within the emerging paradigm of semantic communications.
- The proposed approach leverages semantic and pragmatic aspects, incorporating recent advances on large language models (LLMs) to achieve compact representations of knowledge.
- The cascade of LLMs and graph neural networks (GNNs) are used as semantic encoders, where information to be shared is selected to be meaningful at the receiver.
- The embedding vectors produced by the proposed semantic encoder represent information in the form of triplets: nodes (semantic concepts entities), edges(relations between concepts), nodes.
- The paper investigates the potential of achieving high compression rates in communication by incorporating relations that link elements within graph embeddings.
- The proposed method involves sending semantic symbols solely equivalent to node embeddings through the wireless channel and inferring the complete knowledge graph at the receiver.
- Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of leveraging knowledge graphs to semantically compress and transmit information.

### Major Findings:

1. The proposed end-to-end (E2E) pragmatic optimization semantic communications framework optimizes the transmitter, the latent space representation and compression, and the receiver by representing semantic messages in the form of pragmatically sparsified knowledge graphs.
2. The proposed semantic architecture encodes the knowledge graph in a batch of vectors, each one containing the semantic information about a node, the nodes connected to it, and the relations connecting them.
3. The proposed methodology enhances both compression rates and communication robustness, as demonstrated by numerical simulations.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The paper provides a novel approach to semantic communication by leveraging the cascade of LLMs and GNNs as semantic encoders, which allows for the representation of information in the form of triplets.
- The proposed method achieves high compression rates in communication by incorporating relations that link elements within graph embeddings.
- The paper provides numerical simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, but it does not provide a comparison with other existing methods.
- The paper does not discuss the potential limitations or challenges of the proposed method, such as the computational complexity of the proposed approach or the potential impact
