### Summary:

The paper "How to Understand Whole Software Repository?" (2018) proposes a novel method called RepoUnderstander to address the limitations of existing methods in Automatic Software Engineering (ASE) that mainly focus on local information. The authors argue that a comprehensive understanding of the whole repository is crucial for ASE. RepoUnderstander condenses the critical information of the whole repository into a repository knowledge graph and empowers agents with the ability to understand the whole repository using a Monte Carlo tree search-based repository exploration strategy. The proposed method achieved 18.5% relative improvement on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark compared to SWE-agent.

### Major Findings:

1. The paper highlights the importance of understanding the whole software repository as a critical path to ASE.
2. RepoUnderstander is proposed as a novel method to guide agents in comprehensively understanding entire repositories.
3. The method condenses extensive and complex repository-level information into a hierarchical structure using a repository knowledge graph.
4. A Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) enhanced repository exploration strategy is used to enhance the agents' repository understanding.
5. The agents are guided to summarize, analyze, and plan according to global experiences, enabling them to generate patches to solve real-world GitHub issues.
6. RepoUnderstander demonstrates superior performance in extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses, outperforming existing RAG-based and agent-based systems.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a well-structured and coherent summary of the proposed method, RepoUnderstander, for understanding whole software repositories. The authors effectively communicate the essential information and highlight the major findings of the article. The use of a repository knowledge graph and MCTS-based repository exploration strategy is a novel approach to addressing the limitations of existing methods in ASE.

However, the paper does not discuss potential limitations or biases in the proposed method. It would be beneficial to address any methodological issues, conflicting evidence, or areas that require further research or clarification. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison of RepoUnderstander with other existing methods, which could help readers better understand its advantages and disadvantages.

In conclusion, the paper presents a promising
