### **Summary:**
- RoCode is a competitive programming dataset consisting of 2,642 problems written in Romanian, 11k solutions in C, C++, and Python, and comprehensive testing suites for each problem.
- The purpose of RoCode is to provide a benchmark for evaluating the code intelligence of language models trained on Romanian/multilingual text and as a fine-tuning set for pretrained Romanian models.
- The dataset aims to bridge the gap between Romanian natural language and computer code, providing a challenging set for fine-tuning monolingual models.

### **Major Findings:**
1. RoCode is the first dataset for measuring code intelligence from problem definitions written in Romanian, providing a benchmark for evaluating code generation models for Romanian.
2. Existing Romanian language models, including Ro-GPT2 and GPT-Neo-Ro, are unable to understand the problem definition or produce code, resulting in poor performance.
3. English-oriented models also have poor performance on RoCode, with only a handful of easy problems being solved, and around 18% of solutions resulting in compilation errors across models.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The dataset aims to address the lack of datasets to measure the generalization power for code-generation models in a language other than English, but existing language models, both Romanian and English-oriented, demonstrate poor performance on RoCode.
- The dataset's potential to bridge the gap between Romanian natural language and computer code is hindered by the inability of existing language models to effectively understand and generate code from Romanian problem definitions.
- The findings highlight the need for further research and development of language models specifically tailored for non-English languages, particularly for code generation tasks. Additionally, the dataset's potential as a benchmark for evaluating code intelligence models for Romanian may be limited by the current performance of existing models.
