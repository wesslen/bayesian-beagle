### Major Takeaways
1. **CMOSE Dataset**: The CMOSE dataset is a comprehensive multi-modal online student engagement dataset with high-quality labels that address the challenges of poor label quality, intra-class variation, and extreme data imbalance in engagement detection datasets.
2. **MocoRank Mechanism**: MocoRank, a training mechanism designed to handle data imbalance, intra-class variation, and ordinal relationships for engagement prediction, outperforms prior engagement detection losses and enhances overall and average accuracy.
3. **Multi-Modality Incorporation**: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating different levels of visual features and audio features in engagement prediction through ablation studies and shows that multi-modality can improve model performance.

### Introduction
Online learning has gained attention, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, concerns about the effectiveness of online classes compared to face-to-face classes exist, and research has indicated lower student attention levels in online classes. Therefore, the detection of student engagement in online classes is essential to enhance the learning outcome.

### Existing Datasets and Challenges
- Existing datasets such as DAiSEE and EngageWild separate the degree of engagement into four classes, but face challenges related to unreliable label quality and data imbalance.
- Intra-class variation and ordinal relationships among the four classes are additional challenges in engagement detection datasets.

### CMOSE Dataset
- The CMOSE dataset collects video clips from online presentation training sessions and features engagement labels assigned by raters trained by psychology experts
- The dataset addresses label quality concerns and features a wide range of engagement levels and behaviors in an online learning setting.

### Method: Feature Extraction and Model Structure
- The authors use high-level features, visual features, and audio features in engagement prediction and propose a model structure that combines different levels of visual features and audio features.
- MocoRank, a mechanism specifically designed to handle data imbalance, intra-class variation, and ordinal relationships, is introduced to improve the training process.

### Experiment and Results
- MocoRank outperforms other loss functions in terms of both accuracy and average accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in handling data imbalance.
- Ablation studies show that the incorporation of different modality features and audio features improves model performance.
- The transferability of models pretrained on the CMOSE dataset outperforms models pretrained on other engagement detection datasets, indicating the superior feature transferability of the CMOSE dataset.

### Critique
The paper extensively covers the development and effectiveness of the CMOSE dataset and the proposed MocoRank mechanism. However, the paper could benefit from more detailed discussions on the potential limitations or weaknesses of the proposed approaches and dataset. Additionally, the paper should provide more thorough comparisons with existing methods to better showcase the novel contributions.
