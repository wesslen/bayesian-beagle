### **Summary:**
- The article proposes a framework called Retrieval-Augmented Planning (RAP) that leverages past experiences to enhance decision-making for Large Language Models (LLMs) in both text-only and multimodal environments.
- RAP is designed to dynamically leverage past experiences corresponding to the current situation and context, thereby enhancing agents’ planning capabilities.
- Empirical evaluations demonstrate RAP’s effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance in textual scenarios and notably enhancing multimodal LLM agents’ performance for embodied tasks.

### **Major Findings:**
1. RAP achieves state-of-the-art performance in textual scenarios and notably enhances multimodal LLM agents’ performance for embodied tasks.
2. The framework strategically enriches the decision-making process by storing past experiences and intelligently retrieving them based on their similarity to the current situation.
3. RAP is capable of being applied not only in textual environments but also in multimodal embodied tasks, marking it as a pioneering effort in employing memory retrieval techniques for multimodal agents.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The article provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging past experiences in LLM agent planning, but it would benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential limitations and challenges in implementing the RAP framework.
- The empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of RAP, but further research is needed to explore its applicability in more diverse and complex real-world scenarios.
- The article could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the implications of RAP for the field of machine learning and its potential societal consequences.
