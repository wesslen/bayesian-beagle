The markdown summary of the academic article "Look Before You Leap: Towards Decision-Aware and Generalizable Tool-Usage for Large Language Models" is as follows:

### Summary:
- Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are attracting widespread attention when accessing up-to-date knowledge and alleviating hallucination issues.
- Advanced closed-source LLMs have demonstrated surprising tool-usage capabilities through prompting and in-context learning techniques.
- Current efforts focus on either template-driven or token-triggered tool-usage to empower the capabilities of open-source LLMs in manipulating tools.

### Major Findings:
1. Despite advancements in LLMs, the issues of hallucination and unaccessible up-to-date knowledge limit LLMs to address professional and real-time queries.
2. Recent research on the tool-usage of open-source LLMs can be generally categorized into two paradigms: template-driven tool-usage and token-triggered tool-usage.
3. The proposed decision-aware and generalizable tool-usage framework (DEER) significantly outperforms baselines across various datasets.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The proposed DEER framework enhances the decision-making awareness of LLMs when addressing diverse queries and improves the generalizability of LLMs on new tools.
- The limitations of the study include the labor-intensive process of collecting numerous tool APIs from the real-world and the need for further scaling the method on larger LLMs.

The summary effectively communicates the essential information from the academic article, highlighting the most important findings and providing a critical analysis of the article's potential problems or shortcomings.
