**Summary:**

The paper introduces Private Association Editing (PAE), a novel defense approach for private data leakage in Large Language Models (LLMs). PAE is designed to effectively remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) without retraining the model. The approach consists of a four-step procedure: detecting memorized PII, applying PAE cards to mitigate memorization of private data, verifying resilience to targeted data extraction (TDE) attacks, and ensuring consistency in the post-edit LLMs. The versatility and efficiency of PAE, which allows for batch modifications, significantly enhance data privacy in LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PAE in mitigating private data leakage.

**Major Findings:**

1. PAE is a novel defense approach for private data leakage in LLMs that effectively removes PII without retraining the model.
2. PAE consists of a four-step procedure: detecting memorized PII, applying PAE cards, verifying resilience to TDE attacks, and ensuring consistency in post-edit LLMs.
3. The versatility and efficiency of PAE, which allows for batch modifications, significantly enhance data privacy in LLMs.
4. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PAE in mitigating private data leakage.

**Analysis and Critique:**

1. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of PAE with other existing defense approaches for private data leakage in LLMs.
2. The paper does not discuss the potential impact of PAE on the performance of LLMs, such as accuracy and generalization.
3. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations and potential biases of PAE.
4. The paper does not discuss the potential scalability and applicability of PAE to other types of LLMs and datasets.
5. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the potential impact of PAE on the fairness and transparency of LLMs.
