### Summary:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable cross-lingual alignment and generalization ability.
- This paper conducts several investigations on the linguistic competence of LLMs from the perspective of region partitioning.
- A core region in LLMs corresponds to linguistic competence, accounting for approximately 1% of the total model parameters.
- Removing this core region results in a significant performance decrease across 30 different languages.
- Distinct regions exist for different monolingual families, and disruption to these specific regions substantially reduces the LLMs’ proficiency in those corresponding languages.
- Freezing the core linguistic region during further pre-training can mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF).

### Major Findings:
1. A core region in LLMs corresponds to linguistic competence, accounting for approximately 1% of the total model parameters.
2. Distinct regions exist for different monolingual families, and disruption to these specific regions substantially reduces the LLMs’ proficiency in those corresponding languages.
3. Freezing the core linguistic region during further pre-training can mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF).

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study is limited to LLaMA-2-7B/13B, and it remains to be determined whether the same phenomenon is observable in larger or differently architected models.
- The approach of freezing the core linguistic region during further pre-training may not be suited to extensive datasets, and a more feasible approach is to limit the magnitude of parameter updates.
- The study focuses on linguistic regions, and future research should explore knowledge as a higher-level semantic representation in LLMs.
