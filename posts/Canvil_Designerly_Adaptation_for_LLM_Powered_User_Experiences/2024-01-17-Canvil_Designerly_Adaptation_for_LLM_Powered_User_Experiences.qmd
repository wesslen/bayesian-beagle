**Summary:**

The article discusses the growing role of large language models (LLMs) in shaping user experiences and the need for designers to actively engage with LLMs to ensure responsible and effective user-centered designs. To address this, the practice of "designerly adaptation" is introduced, emphasizing the low technical barrier, leveraging designers' perspectives, and encouraging iterative model tinkering. The authors present Canvil, a Figma widget that facilitates designerly adaptation by supporting the structured authoring of system prompts, testing adapted models, and integrating model outputs into interface designs. Canvil was utilized in a group-based design study to explore the implications and opportunities of integrating designerly adaptation into design workflows.

### Major Findings:
1. **Characteristics of Designerly Adaptation:**
    - **Low Technical Barrier to Entry:** Designerly adaptation emphasizes the need for a low technical barrier, allowing designers without extensive technical expertise to engage effectively.
    - **Leveraging Designers' Perspectives:** The practice encourages leveraging designers' unique viewpoints to bridge user needs and technology and inform model behavior.
    - **Encouraging Model Tinkering:** The adaptation process supports iterative tinkering with models to enhance user interaction and align with user needs.

2. **Canvil as a Technology Probe:**
    - Canvil operationalizes designerly adaptation, allowing for structured authoring of system prompts, model testing, and seamless integration into design workflows.
    - The tool facilitates collaboration and is designed to align with designers' mental models and existing design environments.

3. **Implications of Designerly Adaptation:**
    - Through the design study, it was found that designers could effectively steer LLM behavior to align with user needs, derive interface affordances, and collaborate to enhance user interactions.
    - The study also highlighted the potential for integrating designerly adaptation into design workflows, emphasizing the need for tools that support collaborative AI tinkering and material understanding for designers.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article effectively introduces the concept of designerly adaptation and presents Canvil as a practical implementation of this concept. The structured formative study and the subsequent design study provide empirical support for the effectiveness and potential of integrating designerly adaptation into design workflows. However, the article lacks a comprehensive discussion of potential limitations or challenges in implementing designerly adaptation, and it would benefit from addressing ethical considerations and potential biases that may arise from designers' involvement in model adaptation. Additionally, the generalizability of the findings from the design study to various design contexts and industries could be further explored.
