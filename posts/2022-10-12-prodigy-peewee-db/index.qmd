In a [previous post](https://wesslen-blog.netlify.app/posts/2022-10-11-prodigy-db-intro), I described Prodigy database recipes to manipulate annotations saved in the default database system. However, for your application, you may find you want more database customization . In this post, I will dig into Prodigy's database core concepts and look under the hood.

I'll also show how you can interact with [Prodigy's default database too from Python](#accessing-the-database-programmatically) to enable a more programmatic approach. This enables you to pull from the database using Python, not SQL.

Last, I'll outline experimental database features to highlight possible changes to Prodigy's database system.

If you're new to Prodigy's database, I recommend starting with [Prodigy's Database documentation](https://prodi.gy/docs/api-database) before this post.

## Under the hood: ORM and peewee

As of v1.11.8, Prodigy's database uses an ORM, or "object-relational mapper". The key idea of an ORM is to implement an object-oriented paradigm to managing databases.

By contrast, if you're from data analytics, you've likely used databases as SQL database management systems (DBMS) such as SQLite or MySQL. These systems are not object-oriented. They can only store and manipulate scalar values like strings and integers within tables.

Now wait - you may know that [Prodigy implements by default SQLite](https://prodi.gy/docs/api-database). How can Prodigy use an ORM approach but still implement a DBMS like SQLite?

That's because Prodigy uses [peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/), light-weight and popular open-source ORM, operates as its ORM. There are [many alternative ORMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_object%E2%80%93relational_mapping_software) and they vary by programming language.

 With an ORM, typically you can create a class that represents a table in a SQL database. Each attribute of the class represents a column, with a name and a type. For example, a class named `Animals` can represent a SQL table `animals`. Each instance object of that class represents a row in the database.

So why would we even use an ORM? 

ORM's enable us to interact with our database using our language of choice instead of SQL. Because of Prodigy's ORM, this enables us to interface with our database using Python and not SQL.

Another advantage to ORMs is that they make it easier to switch between different relational databases. Since Prodigy has [configurations for either SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL](https://prodi.gy/docs/api-database), this makes it even easier.

To globally modify your database, you can edit the `db` and `db_settings` in Prodigy's [configuration file](https://prodi.gy/docs/install#config), `prodigy.json`.

## Accessing the database programmatically with Python 

Prodigy’s database model is available from `prodigy.components.db` in Python.

```python
from prodigy.components.db import connect

db = connect("sqlite", {"name": "prodigy.db"}) # default
print(db.datasets)
```

TODO: How to use

TODO: Show data format for data.

```python
from prodigy.components.db import connect

examples = [{"text": "hello world", "_task_hash": 123, "_input_hash": 456}]

db = connect()                               # uses settings from prodigy.json
db.add_dataset("test_dataset")               # add dataset
assert "test_dataset" in db                  # check that dataset was added
db.add_examples(examples, ["test_dataset"])  # add examples to dataset
dataset = db.get_dataset("test_dataset")     # retrieve a dataset
assert len(dataset) == 1                     # check that examples were added
```

## Down the road changes

Earlier in 2022, the Prodigy team released a new [experimental branch in Prodigy Support](https://support.prodi.gy/t/duplicate-annotations-in-output/4961/53) that outlines experimental features in Prodigy's database system.

The new branch includes a new Feed system stores all examples that are to be shown to annotators in the Database. Currently, [Prodigy creates and maps three tables](https://prodi.gy/docs/api-database#setup-tables):

| Table   | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dataset | The dataset / session IDs and meta information.                                                                                                               |
| Example | The individual annotation examples. Each example is only added once, so if you add the same annotation to multiple datasets, it’ll only have one record here. |
| Link    | Example IDs linked to datasets. This is how Prodigy knows which examples belong to which datasets and sessions.                                               |

What is new is a fourth table, Feed, which serves as a buffer to handle the batch of data for multiple annotators. Ultimately, this new Feed will replace Prodigy's current generator-based streams and will aim to reduce issues with multi-user annotators.

This change requires schema changes so it also aligns with a switch to [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) from `peewee` for Prodigy's ORM. One advantage of this switch is that it can enable more database systems beyond SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.

If you're interested in learning more, see this [Prodigy Support issue](https://support.prodi.gy/t/duplicate-annotations-in-output/4961/53), or you can install it:

```bash
pip install prodigy==1.11.8a4 --extra-index-url https://{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}@download.prodi.gy
```

and modify `prodigy.json` such that:

```{.json filename="prodigy.json"}
{
    "experimental_feed": true
}
```
