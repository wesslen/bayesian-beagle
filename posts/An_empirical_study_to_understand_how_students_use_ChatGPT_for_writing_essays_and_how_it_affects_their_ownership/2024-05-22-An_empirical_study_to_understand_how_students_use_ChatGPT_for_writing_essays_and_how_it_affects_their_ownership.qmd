### Summary:

The study aims to understand how students use ChatGPT for essay writing and its impact on their perceived ownership of the work. The researchers plan to conduct a user study that records the user writing process and presents them with the opportunity to use ChatGPT as an AI assistant. The study will focus on the queries asked to ChatGPT and the responses it provides. The findings will help educators and essay readers understand how to approach writing education and evaluation based on essay writing.

### Major Findings:

1. **Understanding ChatGPT Usage**: The study seeks to understand the different ways students use ChatGPT, tracking the queries they make and the responses ChatGPT provides. This will be done by building a system that makes ChatGPT available within the writing platform to record user interactions on a large scale.

2. **Impact on Perceived Ownership**: The study aims to understand how using LLM-powered tools like ChatGPT affects studentsâ€™ perceived ownership of their essays. This will be evaluated through an exit survey that asks users about their feelings towards the essay and their usage of ChatGPT.

3. **Designing Writing Assistant Tools**: The research will help refine how writing assistant tools that integrate LLM-powered intelligence should be designed. It will also provide insights into the level of trust students place in LLMs and the various approaches instructors can adopt to prepare their students to learn writing skills and utilize these tools effectively.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The study's focus on understanding how students use ChatGPT and its impact on their perceived ownership is timely and relevant, given the increasing use of AI tools in education.
- The methodology of tracking user interactions and conducting an exit survey seems appropriate for answering the research questions.
- However, the study's scope is limited to a single essay question and a specific group of students, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
- The study does not explicitly address potential issues of academic integrity, such as plagiarism or cheating, which are significant concerns when using AI tools for writing.
- The study also does not discuss how the findings could be used to develop policies or guidelines for the use of AI tools in education.
- Future research could expand the scope of the study to include a more diverse range of students and essay topics, and explicitly address issues of
