**Summary:**

The paper presents an AI anti-bullying system (AABS) designed to identify and analyze coordinated bullying attacks via social media and other platforms. The system uses a large language model (LLM) to populate an expert system-based network model of a bullying attack, facilitating analysis and remediation activities. The paper discusses the challenges of AI-based bullying, which can be particularly pronounced due to the speed, knowledge, and capabilities of AI. The proposed AABS system aims to give responders, such as parents, teachers, and law enforcement, a capability that is just as effective as that provided to a would-be bully by a basic LLM.

**Key Terms:** AI anti-bullying system (AABS), large language model (LLM), cyberbullying, bullying attack, remediation activities, generative artificial intelligence (GAI)
