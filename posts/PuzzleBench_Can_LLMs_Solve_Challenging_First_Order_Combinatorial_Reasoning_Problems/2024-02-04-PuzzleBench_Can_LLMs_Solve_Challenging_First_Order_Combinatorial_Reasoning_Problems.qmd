### Summary:
- The article discusses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving complex reasoning problems and proposes a new approach called Puzzle-LM to enhance their reasoning abilities.
- The Puzzle-LM approach uses a programmatic symbolic formulator and a symbolic solver to solve first-order combinatorial reasoning problems, outperforming other baselines, especially when feedback and re-runs are utilized.
- The section also addresses the practical limitations and ethical considerations associated with the approach, emphasizing the need for large compute resources and the potential environmental impact of training LLMs.

### Major Findings:
1. The Puzzle-LM approach outperforms other baselines in solving complex reasoning problems, especially with the use of feedback and re-runs.
2. The practical limitations and ethical considerations associated with the approach, such as the need for large compute resources and the environmental impact of training LLMs, are significant.
3. The article provides valuable insights into the reasoning abilities of LLMs and proposes a new approach to address their limitations.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The findings have implications for the development of LLMs and their applications in solving challenging combinatorial reasoning problems.
- The use of feedback from solved examples and re-runs significantly improves the reasoning abilities of the language models.
- The practical limitations and ethical considerations associated with the approach should be carefully considered in the broader context of the paper's contributions.
- The section serves as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners working with puzzle-solving algorithms and datasets.
