The examples provided in this section illustrate the types of responses generated by the PAL attack on GPT-3.5-Turbo-0613 and Llama-2-7B. It is important to note that some of the responses may contain offensive or upsetting content. The purpose of including these examples is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness and limitations of the attack.
