**Overall Summary:**

The paper introduces CityGPT, a framework designed to enhance the capability of large language models (LLMs) in understanding urban space and solving related urban tasks. The authors construct a diverse instruction tuning dataset, CityInstruction, to inject urban knowledge and improve spatial reasoning capabilities. They fine-tune various LLMs using a mixture of CityInstruction and general instruction data, without sacrificing general abilities. To validate the effectiveness of their methods, the authors create a comprehensive benchmark, CityEval, to evaluate LLMs in diverse urban scenarios and problems. The results demonstrate that small LLMs trained with CityInstruction can achieve competitive performance with commercial LLMs in the comprehensive evaluation of CityEval.

**Major Findings:**

1. CityGPT, a framework designed to enhance the capability of LLMs in understanding urban space and solving related urban tasks, significantly outperforms baselines in most tasks, with performance gains ranging from 11.
