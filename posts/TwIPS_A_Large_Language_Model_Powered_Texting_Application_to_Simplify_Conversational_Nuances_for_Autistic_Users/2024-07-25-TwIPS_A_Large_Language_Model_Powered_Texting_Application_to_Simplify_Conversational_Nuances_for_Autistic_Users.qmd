**Summary:**

TwIPS is a prototype texting application powered by a large language model (LLM) designed to assist autistic users in deciphering tone and meaning, ensuring emotional tone alignment, and providing alternative phrasing for messages that could be misconstrued. The application includes three features: Interpret, Preview, and Suggest. Interpret describes the overall tone and meaning of incoming messages and identifies ambiguous language elements. Preview allows users to preview the recipient's likely emotional reaction to their message, and Suggest complements Preview by offering a differently phrased alternative message.

An in-lab user study with 8 autistic participants revealed that TwIPS enabled a convenient way for participants to seek clarifications, provided a better alternative to tone indicators, and facilitated constructive reflection on writing technique and style. Participants' feedback for improving the prototype centered around enhancing personalization and implementing measures to prevent over-relying on the application.

**Major Findings:**

1. TwIPS' Interpret feature enabled users to better understand the overall tone and meaning of messages, including ambiguous language elements.
2. The Preview feature helped prevent misunderstandings by enabling users to preview recipients' likely response to their message and make adjustments before sending.
3. The Suggest feature provided softer, more thoughtful alternative messages, but sometimes undermined users' opinions by softening their original message too much.

**Analysis and Critique:**

1. Establishing appropriate trust levels in Interpret is crucial to prevent over-reliance on the system.
2. Personalizing Preview for diverse age groups and expanding its capabilities to identify messages that become rude with repetition would improve its effectiveness.
3. Tailoring Suggest's message suggestions to fit individual writing styles, preferences, and interests is essential for user satisfaction.
4. Balancing personalization and privacy is a challenge, as personalization may require extensive collection of user data.
5. The double empathy problem highlights the need for measures that encourage neurotypical individuals to contribute to improving communication.
6. Combining AI-based simulations with real-world interactions could create a more long-lasting, personalized, and dynamic tool for autistic users.
7. Practical implications and lessons learned from the study suggest that TwIPS could add value to text
