### Summary:

- The study explores the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems, focusing on their potential to contribute to or alleviate popularity bias.
- A principled way to measure popularity bias is introduced, discussing existing metrics and proposing a novel metric that fulfills a series of desiderata.
- Based on the new metric, a simple LLM-based recommender is compared to traditional recommender systems on a movie recommendation task.
- The LLM recommender exhibits less popularity bias, even without any explicit mitigation.

### Major Findings:

1. LLMs can be integrated into recommender systems, potentially exacerbating popularity bias due to their training data being dominated by popular items.
2. LLMs also provide an opportunity to mitigate popularity bias through prompt tuning, offering a new approach to addressing this issue.
3. A new metric for measuring popularity bias is proposed, which satisfies a set of desiderata for interpretability and statistical robustness.
4. The LLM-based recommender system shows less popularity bias compared to traditional recommender systems, even without explicit mitigation.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The study provides a valuable contribution to the understanding of LLMs in recommender systems and their potential impact on popularity bias.
- The proposed metric for measuring popularity bias is a significant step towards a more principled approach to evaluating this issue.
- However, the study is limited in its scope, focusing only on a movie recommendation task. Further research is needed to assess the generalizability of these findings to other domains and applications.
- Additionally, the study does not address potential methodological issues or conflicting evidence, which could be explored in future work.
- The potential for LLMs to exacerbate popularity bias is a concern, and further research is needed to develop effective strategies for mitigating this issue.
- The study also highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the trade-offs between popularity bias and recommendation accuracy in LLM-based recommender systems.
