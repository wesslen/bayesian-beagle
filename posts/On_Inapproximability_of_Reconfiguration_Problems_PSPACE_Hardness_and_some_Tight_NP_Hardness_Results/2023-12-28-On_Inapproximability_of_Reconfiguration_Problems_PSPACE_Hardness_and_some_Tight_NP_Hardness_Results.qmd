# On Inapproximability of Reconfiguration Problems

## **Summary:**
This paper presents the resolution of the Reconfiguration Inapproximability Hypothesis (RIH) and provides tight results on the NP-hardness of approximation for GapMaxMin-2-CSP and Set Cover Reconfiguration. The authors prove RIH and establish the PSPACE-hardness of approximation results for various reconfiguration problems. They also offer tight NP-hardness results for GapMaxMin-2-CSP and Set Cover Reconfiguration, demonstrating the difficulty of approximating these problems to within certain factors.

## **Major Findings:**
1. The authors resolve the Reconfiguration Inapproximability Hypothesis (RIH), demonstrating the PSPACE-hardness of approximation results for various reconfiguration problems.
2. Tight NP-hardness results for GapMaxMin-2-CSP and Set Cover Reconfiguration are provided, illustrating the challenges in approximating these problems to within particular factors.
3. An approximate algorithm for GapMaxMin-2-CSP is presented, improving upon previous approximation algorithms and showcasing the feasibility of approximating this problem within certain bounds.

## **Critique:**
The paper effectively addresses the inapproximability of reconfiguration problems and provides valuable insights into the complexity of solving these problems. However, the dependency of the alphabet size on the growth of certain factors in the NP-hardness results raises questions about the optimality and scalability of the proposed solutions. Additionally, further investigation into the best achievable approximations and a thorough exploration of the limitations of the presented algorithms could strengthen the paper's conclusions.
