### **Summary:**
- The article introduces the Object Language Video Transformer (i) as a model for video dialog operating over a multi-modal attention-based dialog state tracker.
- It addresses challenges in video dialog models related to spatial and temporal localization, long-term reasoning, and object tracking across dialog turns.
- The model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the DVD (response classification) and SIMMC 2.1 (response generation) datasets.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The Object Language Video Transformer (i) addresses challenges in video dialog models related to spatial and temporal localization, long-term reasoning, and object tracking across dialog turns.
2. The model introduces two attention-based video dialog state trackers for tracking relevant objects and linguistic co-references to previous dialog turns.
3. Empirical results show that the model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the DVD and SIMMC 2.1 datasets.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The article presents a novel approach to video dialog models, addressing key limitations of current methods.
- The model outperforms strong baselines on both the DVD and SIMMC 2.1 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in both discriminative and generative settings.
- The performance of the model is evaluated through quantitative and qualitative analyses, highlighting its strengths in addressing challenges in video dialog systems.
- The article emphasizes the importance of multi-modal dialog state tracking for reliable higher-order reasoning in video dialog systems.
- Future work is suggested to explore the applicability of the model in real-world multi-modal dialog tasks.

Overall, the article provides valuable insights into the development of a novel video dialog model and its potential impact on addressing challenges in multi-modal dialog systems. However, further research may be needed to explore the model's applicability in real-world scenarios and to address any potential limitations or biases in the approach.
