**Summary:**

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a widely recognized psychological intervention for addressing various mental health issues. However, the delivery of CBT faces barriers such as limited access to qualified therapists and lack of personalized interventions. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have provided technical support for the digital transformation of CBT, with the emergence of pre-training models (PTMs) and large language models (LLMs) holding immense potential to support, augment, optimize, and automate CBT delivery.

**Major Findings:**

1. AI can rapidly analyze vast amounts of client data to identify patterns and correlations, assisting therapists in assessing patient symptoms more accurately and swiftly, and identifying adverse emotions and cognitive distortions.
2. AI technology facilitates the identification of cognitive distortions primarily through text classification techniques, utilizing various textual data as inputs to build models and algorithms that automatically identify and categorize these cognitive distortions.
3. AI-assisted emotion analysis has become increasingly prevalent in mental health, with AI-powered models facilitating personalized psychoeducation by tailoring modules to each patientâ€™s understanding and preferences.

**Analysis and Critique:**

While AI has shown promise in enhancing CBT delivery, there are several limitations and challenges that need to be addressed. These include the lack of publicly available structured datasets specifically designed for detecting cognitive distortions, the need for more comprehensive models capable of simultaneously diagnosing multiple co-occurring psychological conditions, and the challenge of making AI responses more conversational and human-like to address the perception that individuals may perceive AI-driven support as lacking genuine emotional resonance compared to human interaction. Additionally, human cross-validation is required to ensure rigor and utility in real clinical settings.

Furthermore, there is a need for more flexible and adaptive forms of CBT to better meet the diverse needs of different patient populations. This can be achieved by exploring the use of AI in various stages of the CBT treatment process, such as pre-treatment, therapeutic process, and post-treatment. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges and exploring the potential of AI in enhancing the effectiveness and accessibility of CBT.
