### **Summary:**
- The study evaluates the navigational performance of large language models (LLMs) in urban environments, focusing on the VELMA navigation model and the LM-NAV model.
- It introduces the Navigational Prompt Suffix (NPS) black-box attack for VELMA-GPT4 and the Navigational Prompt Engineering (NPE) defense for VELMA-LLaMa1 and VELMA-FT.
- The results demonstrate the vulnerability of LLM-based navigation models to perturbations in input prompts, highlighting the need for addressing and mitigating these vulnerabilities.

### Major Findings:
1. **Refinement of Key Points in KPA Metric:**
   - The study refined the approach by exclusively considering intersections as key points, providing a clearer insight into the robotâ€™s ability to navigate complex routes effectively.

2. **Vulnerability of LLMs to NPS Attacks:**
   - The NPS attacks on LLMs, including GPT-4, resulted in a decrease in the KPA metric, indicating the susceptibility of LLMs to systematic manipulation.

3. **Effectiveness of NPE Defense Strategies:**
   - The implementation of NPE defense strategies resulted in improvements across navigational metrics for VELMA-LLaMa and VELMA-FT models, highlighting the potential for enhancing the performance of LLM-based navigation systems.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study provides valuable insights into the vulnerability of LLM-based navigation models, emphasizing the need for addressing these vulnerabilities to enhance their reliability and performance in real-world applications.
- However, the study primarily focuses on the VELMA navigation model, and while it extends its findings to the LM-NAV model, further research on a broader range of LLM-based navigation systems is necessary to establish the universality of these vulnerabilities.
- Additionally, the study could benefit from exploring potential solutions or mitigation strategies to address the identified vulnerabilities, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the implications of LLMs in urban navigation.
