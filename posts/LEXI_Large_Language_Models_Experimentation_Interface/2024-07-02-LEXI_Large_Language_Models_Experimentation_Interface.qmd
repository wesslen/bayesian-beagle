### Summary:

The paper introduces LEXI, a Large Language Models Experimentation Interface, an open-source tool designed to facilitate the deployment of artificial agents powered by LLM in social interaction behavioral experiments. LEXI aims to address the gaps in the current landscape of platforms and tools for deploying customized artificial agents, which are limited by access to technology, standardized interfaces, and controlled experimental setups. The tool offers a graphical interface for building agents and deploying them in experimental setups, along with forms and questionnaires, while collecting interaction logs and self-reported data.

### Major Findings:

1. LEXI provides a user-friendly, open-source interface for researchers to build and deploy artificial agents powered by LLM in social interaction behavioral experiments.
2. LEXI supports the collection of interaction logs and self-reported data, enabling researchers to conduct rigorous, controlled experiments.
3. Usability testing indicates LEXI's broad utility, high usability, and minimum mental workload requirement, with distinctive benefits observed across disciplines.
4. A proof-of-concept study demonstrated LEXI's efficacy in evaluating social human-agent interactions, resulting in high-quality data.
5. A comparison of empathetic versus neutral agents indicated that people perceive empathetic agents as more social, and write longer and more positive messages towards them.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. LEXI's open-source nature and GUI promote transparency and accessibility, enabling a broad spectrum of researchers from diverse research backgrounds to engage with advanced LLM technologies.
2. LEXI's support for open science practices, through its open-source accessibility, directly contributes to ethical research by promoting transparency, inclusivity, and collaborative advancements in HAI research.
3. Researchers need to maintain crucial data privacy principles in mind when using LEXI, as it is an open-source tool deployed by researchers and connects to LLM APIs.
4. LEXI currently offers key features for conducting complex experiments, but further enhancements are planned to afford researchers greater methodological control.
5. Ongoing development and community feedback, involvement, and contribution will be crucial in realizing LEXI's full potential and addressing
