### **Summary:**
- Large language models (LLMs) are sensitive to prompt design, which affects their task performance.
- Existing prompt optimization methods heavily rely on manually annotated gold labels, hindering widespread implementation and generality.
- To address this limitation, the authors propose a gold label-agnostic prompt evaluation (GLaPE) method that eliminates the reliance on gold labels.

### Major Findings:
1. GLaPE utilizes self-consistency as the initial evaluation score and refines the scores of prompts producing identical answers to be mutually consistent.
2. Experimental results show that GLaPE provides reliable evaluations uniform with accuracy, even in the absence of gold labels.
3. GLaPE-based prompt optimization yields effective prompts comparable to accuracy-based ones on six popular reasoning tasks.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The GLaPE method demonstrates a strong correlation with accuracy, making it a robust metric for prompt evaluation and optimization.
- However, the method faces limitations in accurately assessing prompts for complex questions, particularly those that surpass the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs.
- Future research could explore innovative approaches to aggregate assessments on individual questions and augment the granularity of prompt evaluations.
