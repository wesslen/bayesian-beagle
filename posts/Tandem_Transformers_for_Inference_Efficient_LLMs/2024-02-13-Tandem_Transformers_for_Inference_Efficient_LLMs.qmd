### **Summary:**
The article introduces a novel architecture, Tandem transformers, which combines a small autoregressive model with a large model operating in block mode. The architecture substantially improves the small model's predictive accuracy by allowing it to attend to representations from the large model. The Tandem model demonstrates improved performance and speed compared to standalone models and other baselines.

### Major Findings:
1. The Tandem transformers architecture substantially enhances the predictive accuracy of the small model by allowing it to attend to representations from the large model.
2. The Tandem model, comprising of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko, demonstrates improved performance over standalone PaLM2-Gecko and comparable performance to PaLM2-Otter, while being 1.16x faster than PaLM2-Otter.
3. When used within the SPEED setup as a secondary model, the distilled Tandem PaLM2-Gecko model gives around 1.14x speedup over a distilled PaLM2-Gecko model.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The Tandem transformers architecture shows promising results in improving the efficiency and performance of large language models. However, the article does not address potential limitations or biases in the experimental setup.
- The adaptive block length procedure in SPEED is a notable improvement, but further research is needed to evaluate its effectiveness in larger num-samples settings.
- The article provides a comprehensive overview of the Tandem transformers architecture and its performance, but additional research is needed to address potential limitations and further optimize the model for practical applications.
