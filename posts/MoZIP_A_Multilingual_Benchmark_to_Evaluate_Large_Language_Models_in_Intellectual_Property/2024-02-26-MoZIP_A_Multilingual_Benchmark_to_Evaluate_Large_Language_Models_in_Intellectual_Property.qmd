### **Summary:**
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but their performance in specific domains like intellectual property (IP) is not well understood.
- The authors contribute a new benchmark, MoZIP, for evaluating LLMs in the IP domain, which includes three challenging tasks: IPQuiz, IPQA, and PatentMatch.
- They also develop a new IP-oriented multilingual large language model called MoZi, which outperforms other LLMs on the MoZIP benchmark.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The MoZIP benchmark includes three challenging tasks: IPQuiz, IPQA, and PatentMatch.
2. The MoZi model outperforms other well-known LLMs, such as BLOOMZ, BELLE, ChatGLM, and ChatGPT, on the MoZIP benchmark.
3. The performance of current LLMs on the MoZIP benchmark has much room for improvement, and even the most powerful ChatGPT does not reach the passing level.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The MoZIP benchmark is a valuable contribution to evaluating LLMs in the IP domain, but the performance of current LLMs still has much room for improvement.
- The study highlights the deficiencies of LLMs in the IP field at this stage, indicating the need for further research and development in this area.
- The authors provide source code, data, and models for further research, but the study does not address potential biases or limitations in the development of the MoZi model and the MoZIP benchmark. Further exploration of these aspects would enhance the credibility of the findings.
