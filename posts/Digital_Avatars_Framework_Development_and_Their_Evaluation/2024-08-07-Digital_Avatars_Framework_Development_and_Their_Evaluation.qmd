### Summary:

The paper presents a novel prompting strategy for artificial intelligence (AI) driven digital avatars, aiming to improve anthropomorphic features such as humor, authenticity, and favorability. The authors introduce a "show don't tell" prompting strategy, which involves providing an initial prompt with an avatar's background and few-shot examples for relevant scenarios. This strategy is designed to generate more interesting and humorous responses from large language models (LLMs).

To evaluate the effectiveness of their prompting strategy, the authors propose an end-to-end framework for creating high-fidelity AI-driven digital avatars. This framework includes a visualization tool and a Crowd Vote metric, which is an adaptation of Crowd Score, allowing judges to elect an LLM candidate over competitors answering the same or similar prompts.

The authors demonstrate that their AI-driven digital avatars outperform all competitors and baselines in terms of humor, authenticity, and favorability. In the case of Donald Trump and Joe Biden avatars, their authenticity and favorability are rated higher than even their real-world equivalents.

### Major Findings:

1. The "show don't tell" prompting strategy for digital avatars improves humor, authenticity, and favorability in LLM responses, generating more interesting results as measured by the adapted Crowd Score.
2. The Crowd Vote metric, an adaptation of Crowd Score, evaluates competing AI-driven digital avatars on their senses of humor, favorability, and authenticity, showing that the proposed strategy outperforms baseline LLMs and even outperforms the real-world personas the avatars represent.
3. The end-to-end digital framework developed by the authors effectively demonstrates the quality of their prompting results, providing a comprehensive AI-driven digital avatar pipeline that includes a large language model for avatar speaking.

### Analysis and Critique:

While the paper presents an innovative approach to improving the anthropomorphic features of AI-driven digital avatars, there are some potential limitations and areas for further research:

1. The paper focuses on the evaluation of humor, authenticity, and favorability, but other important aspects of human-like interaction, such as empathy and emotional intelligence, are not addressed.
