### **Summary:**
- Recommending cold items is a challenge for collaborative filtering models due to the lack of historical user interactions.
- Existing cold-start models use mapping functions to generate fake behavioral embeddings for cold items, but these have significant differences from real behavioral embeddings.
- The proposed LLM Interaction Simulator (LLM-InS) models users' behavior patterns based on the content aspect, allowing recommender systems to simulate interactions for each cold item and transform them from cold to warm items directly.

### **Major Findings:**
1. LLM-InS outperforms nine state-of-the-art cold-start methods and three LLM models in cold-start item recommendations.
2. The generative embedding simulation models perform better in warm and overall recommendation than dropout embedding simulation models.
3. LLM-InS excels beyond all embedding simulation baseline models in overall, cold, and warm recommendation performance.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The proposed LLM-InS addresses the limitations of conventional cold-start models by leveraging patterns from warm users and items to simulate realistic interactions for cold items.
- The LLM-InS's innovative workflow comprises a large language model-powered sequence of filtering, refining, and updating stages, allowing for effective integration of the recommendation task with LLM.
- The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of LLM-InS, highlighting its superior performance over existing methods and current state-of-the-art LLM recommendation models.
