### **Summary:**
The article introduces EEG-GPT, a new approach to EEG classification that leverages large language models (LLMs) to achieve multi-scale electrophysiological understanding and classification capabilities. The proposed method demonstrates excellent performance in classifying normal from abnormal EEG, utilizing only 2% of training data. Furthermore, it offers transparent and interpretable reasoning steps, promoting trustworthiness in clinical contexts.

### Major Findings:
1. EEG-GPT achieves excellent performance comparable to current state-of-the-art deep learning methods in classifying normal from abnormal EEG in a few-shot learning paradigm utilizing only 2% of training data.
2. The approach provides intermediate reasoning steps and coordinates specialist EEG tools across multiple scales, offering transparent and interpretable step-by-step verification, thereby promoting trustworthiness in clinical contexts.
3. LLMs demonstrate the ability to plan and carry out intermediate reasoning steps when asked to solve complex problems, as well as synergize inputs from other computational "experts" to solve complex tasks.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article presents a promising approach for EEG interpretation and classification using LLMs. However, it is crucial to address the limitations of LLMs, such as their tendency to generate non-factual or "hallucinated" information, which limits their reliability and trustworthiness in clinical settings. Future work should focus on further optimizing performance, evaluating reasoning capabilities, and addressing the potential failure modes of LLMs. Additionally, a step-by-step verifiability with human oversight is recommended to enhance the reliability and interpretability of LLMs in clinical applications.
