### Summary:

This study investigates the impact of English nativeness on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors hypothesize that LLMs, which are predominantly trained on English-speaking datasets, may exhibit biases towards native English speakers, leading to performance discrepancies when interacting with non-native speakers. The study aims to quantify and analyze these performance differences using a newly collected dataset containing over 12,000 unique prompts from native and non-native English speakers worldwide.

### Major Findings:

1. Performance differences: The study finds that LLMs often generate inaccurate responses for non-native English speakers and rate native prompts more positively than intended. These performance differences increase when comparing native English speakers from Western countries with other native and non-native English speakers.
2. Anchoring effect: When the model recognizes or is informed about the user's nativeness, a strong anchoring effect occurs, where the added information substantially affects model performance, leading to increased bias towards native English speakers.
3. Multilingual instruction-tuning dataset: The authors publish a multilingual instruction-tuning dataset containing over 12,000 unique prompts from a diverse group of native and non-native English speakers worldwide, including translations of the prompts into eight different native languages.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. Limitations: The study's dataset, while diverse, may not be representative of all English-speaking populations, as it contains a limited number of annotators for each sub-population. Additionally, the study focuses primarily on annotators with high English proficiency, and the results may not generalize to speakers with lower proficiency levels.
2. Methodological issues: The study does not explicitly address potential confounding factors, such as differences in the complexity or style of prompts between native and non-native English speakers. These factors could contribute to the observed performance differences and should be considered in future research.
3. Potential biases: The study highlights the potential for LLMs to exhibit biases towards native English speakers, which could have implications for the fairness and inclusivity of these models in real-world applications. However, the study does not explore the potential impact of these biases on downstream tasks or the consequences for users.
