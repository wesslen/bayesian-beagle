## Major Takeaways

1. The paper introduces a piloted introductory Java programming course that integrates ethical and socially responsible considerations across modules. The data suggests that **students found the inclusion of the social context in technical assignments to be more motivating and expressed greater agency in realizing social change**.

2. The paper highlights the importance of ensuring goal congruity, emphasizing that students need to perceive an alignment between their personal goals and their ability to fulfill those goals by participating in the field of study. In computing education, a greater emphasis on **agentic goals**, with an inward focus, has been found to be a barrier in enhancing diversity and inclusion in computing.

3. The paper acknowledges the challenges in integrating ethics into computer science (CS) courses and emphasizes the need for praxis-oriented computing courses that build upon ethical considerations toward encouraging students to take responsibility by understanding the power and social impact of technology — engaging with **socially responsible computing**.

## Our Curricular Approach

- **Computing Around Us**: The course started with an examination of the impact of computing on society and discussions on ethical reasoning, power, and social impact analysis. Emphasis was placed on considering impact on individual, communal, and societal levels.

- **Computing By Us and For Us**: The course then transitioned into learning Java programming through socially-grounded assignments, projects intertwining social and technical issues, and individual and collective reflections. 

- **Data Sources and Analysis**: Data was collected through optional surveys and analyzed to understand the students' perceptions and reflections on the course.

## Findings

- **Understanding Computing in a Social Context**: Students expressed appreciation for addressing real-world challenges and found the integration of programming with social issues to be meaningful.

- **Awareness of Justice and Power Relations**: Through the projects, students grappled with power, especially developers’ power, and computing limitations in the face of structural issues.

- **Personal Relevance and Responsibilities**: Students recognized their roles in addressing societal challenges and considered their social responsibilities during assignments and projects.

- **Learning and Conceptual Integration**: The integration of programming with social challenges deepened their understanding of both programming and social problems.

## Discussion and Conclusion

- The paper outlines several challenges faced in the implementation of socially responsible computing in the curriculum, including the need to build trust with and among students, the challenge of being vulnerable to engage in discussions, and the difficulty in dovetailing technical problems with social issues.

- The authors emphasize the importance of ensuring students grasp the limitations of individual responsibilities and acknowledge the need for corporate accountability in socially responsible computing.

## Critique and Potential Problems

The paper provides valuable insights into the integration of socially responsible computing in computer science education. However, there are a few potential problems to consider, including:
- The reliance on student reflections and survey responses as the primary data source may introduce subjective bias and may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the course's effectiveness.
- The challenges faced in the implementation of the course are outlined, but detailed strategies for addressing these challenges are not provided, which may limit the practical applicability of the findings.

Overall, while the paper contributes to the discourse on integrating socially responsible computing in CS education, a more in-depth exploration of the practical implications and potential solutions to the identified challenges would enhance its impact.
