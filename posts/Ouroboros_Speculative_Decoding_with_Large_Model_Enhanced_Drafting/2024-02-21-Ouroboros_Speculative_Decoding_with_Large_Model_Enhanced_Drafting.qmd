### **Summary:**
- Drafting-then-verifying decoding methods are widely used to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs).
- Ouroboros is introduced as a new method to construct a phrase candidate pool from the verification process of LLMs to provide candidates for draft generation of the small model.
- Experimental results show that Ouroboros achieves significant speedups compared to lookahead decoding and speculative decoding.

### Major Findings:
1. Drafting-then-verifying decoding methods are widely used to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs).
2. Ouroboros constructs a phrase candidate pool from the verification process of LLMs to provide candidates for draft generation of the small model.
3. Ouroboros achieves speedups of up to 1.9× and 2.8× compared to lookahead decoding and speculative decoding, respectively.

### Analysis and Critique:
- Ouroboros introduces a new method to accelerate the inference of large language models, providing significant speedups compared to existing decoding methods.
- The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Ouroboros in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the initial drafts.
- The article does not mention any potential problems or shortcomings of the proposed method. However, it would be beneficial to address any limitations or unanswered questions in future research.
