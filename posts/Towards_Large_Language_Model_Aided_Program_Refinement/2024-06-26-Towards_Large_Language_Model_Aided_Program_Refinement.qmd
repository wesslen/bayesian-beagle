### Summary:

The paper introduces LLM4PR, a tool that combines formal program refinement techniques with informal LLM-based methods to transform specifications into pre- and post-conditions, automatically build prompts based on refinement calculus, interact with LLM to generate code, and verify that the generated code satisfies the conditions of refinement, thus guaranteeing the correctness of the code. The tool has been implemented with GPT4 and Coq and evaluated on the HumanEval and EvalPlus datasets.

### Major Findings:

1. LLM4PR is a tool that combines formal program refinement techniques with informal LLM-based methods to generate verified code.
2. The tool has been implemented with GPT4 and Coq and evaluated on the HumanEval and EvalPlus datasets.
3. LLM4PR extends the formal refinement calculus and builds active prompts to the informal LLMs.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents an innovative approach to generating verified code by combining formal program refinement techniques with informal LLM-based methods. The use of LLMs to generate code has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the code generation process. However, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the performance of LLM4PR compared to other code generation tools. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the limitations of LLM4PR, such as the potential for LLMs to generate incorrect or incomplete code. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM4PR and to address its limitations.
