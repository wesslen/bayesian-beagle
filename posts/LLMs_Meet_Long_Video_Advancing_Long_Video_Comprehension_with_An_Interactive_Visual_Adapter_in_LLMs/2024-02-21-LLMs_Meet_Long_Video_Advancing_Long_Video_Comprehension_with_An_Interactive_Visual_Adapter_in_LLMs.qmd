### **Summary:**
- Long video understanding is a significant challenge in multimedia and AI.
- Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a promising method for video comprehension.
- An Interactive Visual Adapter (IVA) within LLMs is proposed to enhance interaction with fine-grained visual elements.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The proposed video-LLM with IVA facilitates comprehensive understanding of long video content through appropriate long video modeling and precise visual interactions.
2. Extensive experiments on nine video understanding benchmarks show that IVA significantly improves the performance of video LLMs on long video QA tasks.
3. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of IVA in long and short video understandings.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The proposed IVA significantly improves the performance of LLMs in understanding long videos, but there is a need for further optimization for longer videos.
- The impact of interaction frequency and query token length on the stability and effectiveness of IVA needs to be further investigated.
- The potential for LLMs to generate inaccurate or inappropriate responses is a limitation that requires attention.
