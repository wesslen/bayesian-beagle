### **Summary:**
- TreeEval is a benchmark-free evaluation method for Large Language Models (LLMs) that aims to prevent data leakage and ensure efficient evaluation.
- The method uses a high-performance LLM as an examiner to generate a series of questions under a topic with a tree planning strategy, ensuring completeness and efficiency of the evaluation process.
- TreeEval achieved the highest correlation coefficient with AlpacaEval2.0 using only around 10 questions and demonstrated robustness and reliability.

### **Major Findings:**
1. TreeEval achieved the highest correlation coefficient with AlpacaEval2.0 using only around 10 questions.
2. The method uses a high-performance LLM as an examiner to generate questions under a topic with a tree planning strategy, ensuring completeness and efficiency of the evaluation process.
3. TreeEval demonstrated robustness and reliability in evaluating models of different parameter sizes.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The method efficiently evaluates LLMs with minimum questions, but it may fail when evaluating content that the examiner isnâ€™t proficient in.
- TreeEval showed high consistency with AlpacaEval, but the choice of the baseline model is critical and can impact the evaluation results.
- The method demonstrated robustness and reliability, but it is important to consider potential biases and limitations in the evaluation process.
