### **Summary:**

- Foundation models, like Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown significant potential in various applications.
- Appropriate prompt design, such as Chain-of-Thoughts, can unlock LLM's powerful capacity in diverse areas.
- However, when handling tasks involving repetitive sub-tasks and deceptive contents, existing prompting strategies may suffer from insufficient expressive power or intermediate errors triggered by hallucination.
- The paper proposes a Divide-and-Conquer program to guide LLMs, ensuring superior expressive power and disentangling task decomposition, sub-task resolution, and resolution assembly processes.
- Theoretical analysis and experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms typical prompting strategies in tasks with intermediate errors and deceptive contents.

### **Major Findings:**

1. The Divide-and-Conquer program guides LLMs to handle tasks with intermediate errors and deceptive contents more effectively.
2. The proposed method extends the expressive power of fixed-depth Transformer, achieving better performance in tasks with intermediate errors and deceptive contents.
3. The Divide-and-Conquer program ensures a clear separation of tasks, reducing the likelihood of intermediate errors and improving overall model performance.

### **Analysis and Critique:**

- The paper presents a novel approach to addressing intermediate errors and deceptive contents in LLMs by introducing a Divide-and-Conquer program.
- The theoretical analysis and experimental results support the proposed method's effectiveness.
- However, the paper could benefit from further exploration of the Divide-and-Conquer program's limitations and potential issues, such as the impact of task complexity and the scalability of the approach.
- Investigating the Divide-and-Conquer program's applicability to other foundation models and tasks could provide valuable insights for future research.
- Addressing the potential impact of deceptive contents on the Divide-and-Conquer program's performance would strengthen the paper's contribution.
