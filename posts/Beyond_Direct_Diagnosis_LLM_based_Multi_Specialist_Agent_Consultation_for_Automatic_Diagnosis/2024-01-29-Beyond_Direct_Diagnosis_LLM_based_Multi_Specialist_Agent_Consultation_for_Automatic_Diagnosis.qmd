### **Summary:**
The article introduces an Agent-derived Multi-Specialist Consultation (AMSC) framework for automatic diagnosis using large language models (LLMs) and medical knowledge. The study demonstrates the superiority of the AMSC approach compared to existing baselines, with significantly less parameter updating and training time, enhancing efficiency and practical utility. The AMSC framework also delves into a novel perspective on the role of implicit symptoms within the context of automatic diagnosis.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The AMSC framework outperforms existing baselines in terms of diagnostic accuracy, training duration, and the average number of turns required for implicit symptom inquiry.
2. The inclusion of implicit symptoms does not necessarily enhance the performance of the AMSC framework, indicating that explicit symptoms alone can effectively reflect a patient's condition to a specialist agent.
3. Medical knowledge significantly impacts the performance of the AMSC framework, with deliberately misaligned disease-knowledge pairings adversely affecting diagnostic accuracy.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
The AMSC framework demonstrates promising results in the context of automatic diagnosis, with the potential to generalize to real-world scenarios. The study raises important considerations regarding the role of implicit symptoms and medical knowledge in automated diagnostic systems. Additionally, the adaptive probability distribution fusion method introduced in the study shows significant promise in enhancing the effectiveness of the AMSC framework. However, further research is needed to explore the impact of implicit symptoms and medical knowledge in different clinical contexts and to validate the generalizability of the AMSC framework. Additionally, the study could benefit from addressing potential ethical considerations and limitations associated with the use of large language models in medical diagnostics.
