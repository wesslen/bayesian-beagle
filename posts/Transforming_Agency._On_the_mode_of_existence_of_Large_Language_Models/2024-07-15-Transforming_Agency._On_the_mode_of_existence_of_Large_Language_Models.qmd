**Summary:**

The article "Transforming Agency" by Xabier E. Barandiaran and Lola S. Almendros explores the ontological characterization of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The authors focus on their status as agents and explain the architecture, processing, and training procedures that enable LLMs to display their capacities. They argue that LLMs fail to meet necessary and sufficient conditions for autonomous agency in the light of embodied theories of mind. The authors conclude that ChatGPT should be characterized as an interlocutor or linguistic automaton, devoid of (autonomous) agency, but capable of engaging performatively on non-purposeful yet purpose-structured and purpose-bounded tasks. Despite their lack of sensorimotor and biological embodiment, LLMs significantly transform existing forms of human agency.

**Major Findings:**

1. ChatGPT
