# Summary

The paper investigates the factual recall behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Knowledge Neurons (KNs). The study reveals that LLMs do not consistently retrieve the relevant factual knowledge necessary for reasoning, with more than a third of reasoning errors stemming from deficiencies in the retrieval of factual associations. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can significantly enhance the recall of factual knowledge by facilitating step-by-step reasoning, reducing the likelihood of shortcuts. By enhancing and suppressing the recall process, the study demonstrates that successful factual retrieval is a pivotal factor in improving reasoning performance. The presence of knowledge conflict in context can enhance the retrieval of the corresponding fact in the reasoning process to a degree.

## Major Findings

1. LLMs do not consistently retrieve the relevant factual knowledge necessary for reasoning, with more than a third of reasoning errors stemming from deficiencies in the retrieval of factual associations.
2. CoT prompting can significantly enhance the recall of factual knowledge by facilitating step-by-step reasoning, reducing the likelihood of shortcuts.
3. By enhancing and suppressing the recall process, the study demonstrates that successful factual retrieval is a pivotal factor in improving reasoning performance.
4. The presence of knowledge conflict in context can enhance the retrieval of the corresponding fact in the reasoning process to a degree.

## Analysis and Critique

The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the factual recall behaviors of LLMs, highlighting the importance of successful factual retrieval in improving reasoning performance. However, the study is limited to specific LLMs and the TFRKN dataset, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The paper also lacks a deeper theoretical analysis to fully comprehend the underlying reasons for the observed phenomena. Additionally, the paper does not delve into how these findings can be applied in practical scenarios to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The impact of various contextual factors on reasoning is also not comprehensively analyzed.
