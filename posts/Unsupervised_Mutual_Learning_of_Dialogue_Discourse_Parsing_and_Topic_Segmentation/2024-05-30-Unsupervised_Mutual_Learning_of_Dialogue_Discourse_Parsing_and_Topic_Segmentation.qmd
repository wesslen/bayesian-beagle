# Summary

The paper proposes an unsupervised mutual learning framework for discourse parsing and topic segmentation, leveraging the connections between rhetorical and topic structures. The authors present two hypotheses: topic structure can indicate the skeleton of rhetorical structure, and rhetorical structure can refine the differences between topics. The framework includes two unsupervised discourse parsing and topic segmentation modules, integrated using topic connection amplification and graph neural networks. The experimental results demonstrate that the framework improves discourse parsing and topic segmentation performance without extra annotated information. In-depth analysis validates the hypotheses and the method's generalization.

## Major Findings:

1. The proposed unsupervised mutual learning framework for discourse parsing and topic segmentation improves performance without requiring extra annotated information.
2. The framework's effectiveness is validated through in-depth qualitative and quantitative analysis, proving the correctness of the hypotheses and the method's generalization.
3. The framework can be integrated with large-scale language models for downstream tasks, such as constructing a novel task-based dialogue system.

## Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel approach to discourse parsing and topic segmentation, leveraging the connections between rhetorical and topic structures. The proposed framework is unsupervised, which is a significant advantage as it reduces the need for annotated data. The experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in improving performance without requiring extra annotated information.

However, the paper has some limitations. The majority of the experiments were conducted in unsupervised settings, and there is a lack of robust experimental evidence and validation regarding the mutual influence of rhetorical and topic structures in supervised scenarios. Additionally, due to space constraints, the paper does not expand on the significance of the results in downstream tasks or integrate them with the generative capabilities of large models. These aspects should be addressed in future work.

Overall, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of discourse parsing and topic segmentation, offering a promising approach to improving performance without requiring extra annotated information. The proposed framework has the potential to be integrated with large-scale language models for downstream tasks, making it a valuable area for further research.
