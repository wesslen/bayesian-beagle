### **Summary:**
- This article introduces a new approach to building a text embedder that captures characteristics of texts specified by user instructions.
- The proposed method treats the instruction as a question about the input text and encodes the expected answers to obtain the representation accordingly.
- The InBedder framework fine-tunes language models on abstractive question answering tasks and demonstrates significantly improved instruction-following capabilities.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The proposed InBedder framework outperforms traditional text embedders in capturing user-specific objectives.
2. The use of abstractive question answering datasets for fine-tuning language models significantly enhances the instruction-following capabilities of the text embedder.
3. InBedder demonstrates robustness to different types of instructions, including correct, implicit, and incorrect instructions.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The article presents a novel and promising approach to instruction-following text embedding, addressing a challenging problem in text analysis.
- However, the efficiency of the proposed InBedder framework for large-scale retrieval tasks is identified as a potential limitation.
- The article acknowledges the need for further exploration of prompt design and task description to optimize performance on generic sentence embedding tasks.
