### **Summary:**
- The study explores the impact of AI tools, specifically GitHub Copilot, on software engineering practices within ANZ Bank.
- The experiment showed a notable boost in productivity and code quality with GitHub Copilot, although its impact on code security remained inconclusive.
- Participant responses were overall positive, confirming GitHub Copilot's effectiveness in large-scale software engineering environments.

### Major Findings:
1. **Productivity and Code Quality:** The experiment showed a significant increase in productivity and code quality with GitHub Copilot, with participants in the Copilot group completing tasks 42.36% faster than the control group.
2. **Security:** The study did not generate meaningful data to measure the impact of GitHub Copilot on code security.
3. **Sentiment Around Copilot:** Participants felt positively about GitHub Copilot, reporting that it helped them review and understand existing code, create documentation, and test their code.

### Analysis and Critique:
- **Limitations:** The study had limitations in sample size, engagement levels, and the nature of programming questions, which impacted the robustness of the conclusions drawn.
- **Security Analysis:** The experiment could not generate meaningful data to measure the impact of GitHub Copilot on code security, which is a significant limitation.
- **Biases:** Biases such as the Dunning-Kruger effect and positive predisposition towards the tool may have affected the accuracy of self-reported proficiency levels and sentiment data.
- **Future Work:** The study recommends productionizing GitHub Copilot at ANZ Bank based on the evidence of its transformative impact on engineering practices. Further research is ongoing to quantify the tool's impact on operational efficiency and overall performance at ANZ Bank.
