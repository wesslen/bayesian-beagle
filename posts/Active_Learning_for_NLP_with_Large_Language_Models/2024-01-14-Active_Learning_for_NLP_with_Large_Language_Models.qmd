### Summary:
The article explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for annotating samples in Active Learning (AL) to reduce labeling costs and enhance sample efficiency, particularly for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The study investigates the accuracy and cost of using LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to label samples on different datasets. A mixed annotation strategy is proposed, combining LLM and human annotations, and its performance under various AL settings is evaluated. The results suggest that using LLMs as annotators in AL settings can be cost-efficient while maintaining high accuracy levels, showing potential for reducing annotation costs.

### Major Findings:
1. LLMs, particularly GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, demonstrate cost efficiency and reasonable accuracy when used for annotating samples in AL, offering potential for reducing labeling costs.
2. A mixed annotation strategy, combining LLM and human annotations, yields similar or better results compared to using human annotations only, particularly on tasks such as news topic and movie review classifications.
3. The proposed consistency-based label fixing strategy shows potential for improving the accuracy of AL models by utilizing LLM annotations and correcting incorrectly labeled samples with human annotations.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the potential of LLMs for annotating samples in AL, offering cost efficiency and maintaining accuracy. However, there are some limitations and potential areas for further investigation:
- It's important to acknowledge that the study is based on a limited number of experiments and runs, potentially requiring further validation and replication to ensure the generalizability of the findings.
- The potential biases or limitations associated with using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, such as their performance on new datasets and their behavior on specific tasks like question classification, deserve further investigation to ensure the robustness of the proposed approach.
- The article does not address the ethical implications of relying on LLMs for annotation, including concerns related to bias, fairness, and transparency in the labeling process. Further research should consider addressing these ethical considerations when implementing LLMs in AL settings.

Overall, while the article presents promising findings regarding the use of LLMs in AL for NLP tasks, further research and comprehensive validation are necessary to fully assess the effectiveness and potential limitations of this approach.
