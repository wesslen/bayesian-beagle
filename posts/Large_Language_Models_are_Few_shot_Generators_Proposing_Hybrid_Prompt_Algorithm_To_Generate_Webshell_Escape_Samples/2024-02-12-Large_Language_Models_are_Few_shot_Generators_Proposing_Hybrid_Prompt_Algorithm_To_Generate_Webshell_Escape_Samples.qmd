### Summary:
- The article proposes the Hybrid Prompt algorithm for webshell escape sample generation, addressing the limitations of weak webshell sample escape capabilities and the lack of complex webshell datasets.
- The Hybrid Prompt algorithm leverages large language models (LLM) and prompt engineering techniques to generate high-quality webshell samples with high escape and survival rates.
- The "Symbol Interference" module of the encrypted webshell sample results in a high probability of hallucination when LLM executes, leading to subsequent generation errors.
- The experimental setup includes testing LLM's ability to generate escape samples, evaluating the effectiveness of the Hybrid Prompt algorithm, and analyzing the impact of the number of candidates on performance.
- The section also discusses the application of LLM in code-related tasks and research on webshell detection techniques, categorizing the research in webshell detection into three stages.
