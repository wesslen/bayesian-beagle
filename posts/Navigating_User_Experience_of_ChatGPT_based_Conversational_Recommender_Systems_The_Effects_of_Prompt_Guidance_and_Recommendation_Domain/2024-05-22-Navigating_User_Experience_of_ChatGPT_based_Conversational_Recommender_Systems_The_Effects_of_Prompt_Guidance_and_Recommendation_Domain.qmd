### Summary:

- The study investigates the impact of prompt guidance (PG) and recommendation domain (RD) on the user experience (UX) of a ChatGPT-based conversational recommender system (CRS).
- The research employs a mixed-method online empirical study with 100 participants, using a between-subjects design for PG (with vs. without) and a within-subjects design for RD (book recommendations vs. job recommendations).
- The findings reveal that PG significantly enhances the system's explainability, adaptability, perceived ease of use, and transparency.
- Users perceive a greater sense of novelty and demonstrate a higher propensity to engage with and try recommended items in the context of book recommendations compared to job recommendations.
- The influence of PG on certain UX metrics and interactive behaviors is modulated by the RD, as evidenced by interaction effects between the two factors.

### Major Findings:

1. Prompt guidance (PG) substantially improves the system's explainability, adaptability, perceived ease of use, and transparency.
2. Users are more inclined to perceive novelty and engage with recommended items in the context of book recommendations compared to job recommendations.
3. The influence of PG on certain UX metrics and interactive behaviors is modulated by the RD, as evidenced by interaction effects between the two factors.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The study's primary participants were native English speakers, which may not reflect the UX of such a system from a non-native English speaker's perspective.
- The analysis of results mainly focuses on quantitative data, and future analysis should associate with qualitative data to gain a deeper understanding of user behavior and perceptions.
- Despite extensive testing and optimization, the designed prompt guidance may not enable ChatGPT to perform at its best in recommendation tasks.
- The study contributes to the user-centered evaluation of ChatGPT-based CRS by exploring two influential factors and provides insights into the UX design of ChatGPT-based CRS.
