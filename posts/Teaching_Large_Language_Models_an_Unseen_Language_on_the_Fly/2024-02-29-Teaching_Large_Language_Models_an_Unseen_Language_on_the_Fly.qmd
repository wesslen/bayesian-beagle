### **Summary:**

- Existing large language models (LLMs) struggle with numerous low-resource languages, particularly extremely low-resource ones with minimal training data.
- This study investigates whether LLMs can learn a new language on the fly solely through prompting, focusing on Zhuang, an extremely low-resource language.
- The authors introduce DiPMT++, a framework for adapting LLMs to unseen languages by in-context learning, using a dictionary and 5K parallel sentences.
- DiPMT++ significantly enhances the performance of GPT-4 for Chinese-to-Zhuang translation and achieves 32 BLEU for Zhuang-to-Chinese translation.
- The study demonstrates the practical utility of this framework in aiding humans to translate completely unseen languages, contributing to the preservation of linguistic diversity.

### Major Findings:
1. Existing LLMs perform poorly in supporting numerous low-resource languages, particularly extremely low-resource languages.
2. The study introduces DiPMT++, a framework for adapting LLMs to unseen languages through in-context learning, using a dictionary and 5K parallel sentences.
3. DiPMT++ significantly enhances the performance of GPT-4 for Chinese-to-Zhuang translation and achieves 32 BLEU for Zhuang-to-Chinese translation.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study focuses on Zhuang, an extremely low-resource language, and introduces DiPMT++, a framework for adapting LLMs to unseen languages through in-context learning.
- The study demonstrates the practical utility of this framework in aiding humans to translate completely unseen languages, contributing to the preservation of linguistic diversity.
- The sample size of the study is relatively small, with only 200 Zhuang-Chinese testing instances and 50 Kalamang-English testing instances.
- The typology of the studied languages may lead to overly optimistic conclusions, as Zhuang and Chinese share many similarities.
- The scope of studied methods is limited, with the exploration of explicitly learning syntactic information being restricted to analyzing a specific syntactical phenomenon with CoT reasoning.
