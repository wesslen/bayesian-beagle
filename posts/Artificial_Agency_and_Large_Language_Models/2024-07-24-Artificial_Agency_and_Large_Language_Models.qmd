# Summary

The paper "Artificial Agency and Large Language Models" by Maud van Lier and Gorka Muñoz-Gil explores the philosophical debates surrounding the possibility of realizing agency in an artificial manner. The authors propose a theoretical model that can be used as a threshold conception for artificial agents. The model defines agents as systems whose actions and goals are always influenced by a dynamic framework of factors, including the agent's accessible history, its adaptive repertoire, and its external environment. The paper argues that a combination of the agent architecture presented in Park et al. (2023) and the use of modules like the Coscientist in Boiko et al. (2023) could potentially be a way to realize agency in an artificial manner.

## Major Findings

1. The paper proposes a theoretical model for artificial agents that is based on a dynamic framework of factors, including the agent's accessible history, its adaptive repertoire, and its external environment.
2. The paper argues that current state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) are not agents yet, but that there are elements to them that suggest a way forward.
3. The paper suggests that a combination of the agent architecture presented in Park et al. (2023) and the use of modules like the Coscientist in Boiko et al. (2023) could potentially be a way to realize agency in an artificial manner.

## Analysis and Critique

The paper provides a valuable contribution to the philosophical debates surrounding the possibility of realizing agency in an artificial manner. The proposed theoretical model for artificial agents is well-structured and provides a clear framework for understanding the factors that influence an agent's actions and goals. However, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed model. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential ethical implications of realizing agency in an artificial manner. Further research is needed to address these issues and to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach.
