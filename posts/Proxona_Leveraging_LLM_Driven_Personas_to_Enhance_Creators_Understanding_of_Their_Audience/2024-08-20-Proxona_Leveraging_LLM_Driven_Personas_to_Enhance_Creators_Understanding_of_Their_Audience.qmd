**Summary:**

Proxona is a system that helps creators understand their audience by interacting with data-driven personas, represented with distinct dimensions and values. These personas are generated using large language models (LLMs) and are based on audience comments. The system was evaluated through a technical evaluation and a user study with 11 YouTube creators. The results showed that Proxona effectively generated relevant, distinct, audience-reflecting personas with evidence-based responses. The user study also found that Proxona helped creators better understand their audience and make informed decisions in their creative practices.

**Major Findings:**

1. Proxona's technical pipeline effectively generated relevant, distinct, audience-centric personas with the persona construction framework (dimensions & values) that provide evidence-based responses.
2. Empirical findings from user studies showed that Proxona could help creators enhance their understanding of their audience and make informed decisions in their creative practices.
3. Formative study findings captured design opportunities to support content creators in better targeting their audience.

**Analysis and Critique:**

Proxona's use of LLMs to generate virtual audiences grounded on audience comments is a novel approach to understanding audience preferences. The system's ability to cluster comments by the similarity of audience characteristics and minimize hallucinations in persona responses is a significant achievement. However, the system's reliance on LLMs may introduce biases or inaccuracies in the generated personas. Additionally, the system's effectiveness may be limited for creators with a small number of comments or those who do not have access to large-scale comment data. The system's potential for scalability and generalizability to other creative domains beyond YouTube content creation is also worth exploring.
