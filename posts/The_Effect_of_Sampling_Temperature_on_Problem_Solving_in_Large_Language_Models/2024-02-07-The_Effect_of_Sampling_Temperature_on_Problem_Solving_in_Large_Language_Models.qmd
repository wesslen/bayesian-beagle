### **Summary:**
- The study investigates the effect of sampling temperature on Large Language Models (LLMs) for problem-solving tasks.
- An MCQA exam was created by sampling problems from standard LLM benchmarks and four popular LLMs were used with five prompt-engineering techniques.
- Results indicate that changes in temperature in the range 0.0 to 1.0 do not have a statistically significant impact on LLM performance for problem-solving tasks.

### Major Findings:
1. Changes in sampling temperature in the range 0.0 to 1.0 do not have a statistically significant impact on LLM performance for problem-solving tasks.
2. The study found that higher temperatures increase the probability of model hallucination, but do not significantly improve MCQA solution-space search.
3. Visual examination of the performance of GPT-3.5 across prompts and problem domains did not reveal any discernible trends in correct-answer accuracy as a function of temperature.

### Analysis and Critique:
- Limitations:
  - The study was limited to a small subset of problems, problem domains, and problem-solving tasks.
  - Only a small subset of prompt-engineering techniques using a single prompt-and-response cycle with one-shot in-context learning was explored.
  - Due to cost considerations, the exploration of system prompts and problem domains was limited to GPT-3.5.
- Implications:
  - The findings have practical implications for AI engineers using LLMs to create new AI systems and theoretical implications for AI researchers studying model hallucination and solution-space search with LLMs.
- Future Research:
  - Additional experiments with more MCQA problems and problem domains are recommended.
  - Experiments with additional LLMs and a more in-depth error analysis to determine sensitivity to changes in sampling temperature are suggested.
