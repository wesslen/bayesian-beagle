# Summary:

The paper presents a novel approach to improve evaluators for large language models (LLMs) without relying on human annotations. The proposed method, called Self-Taught Evaluator, uses synthetic training data and an iterative self-improvement scheme to generate contrasting model outputs and train an LLM-as-a-Judge to produce reasoning traces and final judgments. The approach is demonstrated to improve a strong LLM (Llama3-70B-Instruct) from 75.4 to 88.3 (88.7 with majority vote) on RewardBench, outperforming commonly used LLM judges such as GPT-4 and matching the performance of top-performing reward models trained with labeled examples.

# Major Findings:

1. The Self-Taught Evaluator method significantly improves the performance of a strong LLM (Llama3-70B-Instruct) on RewardBench, from 75.4 to 88.3 (88.7 with majority vote), without using any labeled preference data.
2. The proposed approach outperforms commonly used LLM judges such as GPT-4 and matches the performance of the top-performing reward models trained with labeled examples.
3. The iterative training scheme used in the Self-Taught Evaluator method allows for continuous improvement of the LLM-as-a-Judge model, as it is trained on its own predictions and the generated synthetic data.

# Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper presents an innovative approach to improving evaluators for LLMs, addressing the limitations of relying on human annotations and the cost and time associated with collecting them.
2. The proposed method demonstrates promising results, outperforming commonly used LLM judges and matching the performance of top-performing reward models trained with labeled examples.
3. However, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the proposed approach with other methods that use synthetic data or unsupervised learning for improving evaluators.
4. The paper also does not discuss the potential limitations or biases introduced by using synthetic data and the iterative self-improvement scheme, which could be a topic for future research.
5. The proposed method is demonstrated to work well for a specific LLM
