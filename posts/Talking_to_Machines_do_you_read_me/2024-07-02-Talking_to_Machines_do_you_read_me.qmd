**Summary:**

This academic paper provides an overview of the research on dialogue systems, focusing on the contributions of Lina Mar√≠a Rojas Barahona. The author discusses her work on task-oriented dialogues and conversational question answering, as well as her role as an industrial supervisor for four PhD theses. The paper also briefly reviews the state of the art in conversational agents and highlights open research problems. The author emphasizes the progress made in dialogue systems since the introduction of Eliza, the automated psychoanalyst, in 1966. She notes that while early systems were limited by poor understanding and lack of expressivity, recent advances in deep learning and data-driven techniques have led to promising results in creating artificial agents capable of conversing with humans.

The paper explores various aspects of dialogue systems, including the use of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) in spoken dialogue systems, Machine Learning (ML)
