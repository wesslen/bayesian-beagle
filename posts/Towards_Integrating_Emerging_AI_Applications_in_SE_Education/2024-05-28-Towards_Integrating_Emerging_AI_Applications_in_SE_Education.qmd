### Summary:

- The paper presents a preliminary analysis of current trends in AI and their potential integration into software engineering (SE) curricula.
- The study focuses on identifying opportunities for AI applications and further research areas in SE education.
- The authors collected both teaching and research papers and analyzed their potential usage in SE education using the ACM Computer Science Curriculum Guidelines CS2023.
- The paper discusses a series of opportunities for AI applications and further research areas, including test case generation, architecture pattern creation, and bug detection.

### Major Findings:

1. **AI in Introductory Programming Education**: AI can be integrated into courses for novice programmers to enhance the learning experience and address educational challenges. This includes the application of large language models (LLMs) to block-based languages and AI-based code generation tools for real-time coding assistance.
2. **AI in Design and Construction**: AI can be employed in software design to discover and understand application programming interfaces (APIs). In software construction, recent studies have highlighted the robustness of code generation techniques, such as GitHub Copilot, which automatically generates code from natural language descriptions.
3. **AI in Maintenance and Testing**: AI can be integrated into advanced SE courses to foster awareness of new tools and technologies. This includes automated test case generation or test augmentation support and the use of LLMs to generate a series of test candidates.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of current trends in AI and their potential integration into SE curricula.
- The authors have identified several areas of opportunities where AI could support both educators and students in various tasks.
- However, the paper does not provide a detailed methodology for the literature review, which could impact the validity and reliability of the findings.
- The paper also does not discuss the potential challenges and limitations of integrating AI into SE education, such as the need for ethical considerations and the potential for AI to perpetuate biases.
- Further research is needed to investigate the long-term impacts of AI integration on learning outcomes and employability of students.
