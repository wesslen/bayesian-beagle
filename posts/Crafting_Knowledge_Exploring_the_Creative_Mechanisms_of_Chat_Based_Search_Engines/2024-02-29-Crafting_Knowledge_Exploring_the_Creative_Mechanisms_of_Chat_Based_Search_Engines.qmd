### Research Summary

**Summary:**

- Chat-based search engines, like Bing Chat and Bard, are a new category of chatbots that combine search engine capabilities with large language models (LLMs) to deliver responses in natural language.
- These chat-based search engines demonstrate human-like metacognitive skills, including the acquisition of new knowledge and the demonstration of creativity.
- The "cognitive" process through which chatbots discern pertinent information and formulate final responses remains largely inscrutable due to the complexity of the underlying LLMs.
- The visibility of a website in chat-based search engines is crucial, as it influences decision-making processes and the distribution of welfare among stakeholders.
- The study aims to investigate the criteria for citation in chat-based search engines and compare them with the ranking criteria of conventional search engines.

### Major Findings
