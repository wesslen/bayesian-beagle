### Major Takeaways
1. **Explainable AI (XAI)** has become increasingly important as AI systems play a pivotal role in high-stakes decision-making. The paper introduces the **Cognitive Learning with Explainable AI (CL-XAI)** system, focusing on human-centered AI problem-solving and cognitive learning.
2. The paper explores how human learners comprehend AI models using XAI tools and evaluates the effectiveness of such tools through human feedback, demonstrating the potential for transformative advances in cognitive learning and co-learning.
3. The CL-XAI system is illustrated with a game-inspired virtual use case where learners tackle combinatorial problems to enhance problem-solving skills and deepen their understanding of complex concepts.

### Introduction
- The paper addresses the need for co-learning and effective human-AI collaboration in problem-solving and optimal decision-making. It emphasizes the importance of human insight and feedback in enhancing AI capabilities.

### Background
- Cognitive learning is highlighted as a pedagogical approach emphasizing the development of comprehensive mental models among learners, with potential for enhancing problem-solving skills and deepening understanding of complex concepts.
- The previous research into explainable recommendation systems in education is mentioned, along with the traditional use of worked examples in various fields.

### CL-XAI
- The CL-XAI tool is introduced, encompassing the explanation method, a virtual use case, and a game-inspired user study for learners to enhance their learning and knowledge about AI model artifacts when solving problems.

### Subjective Evaluation Measures
- The paper proposes an evaluation framework for the CL-XAI system, focusing on factors such as explanation goodness, user satisfaction, user understanding, and task learning, aiming to uncover how explanation quality influences cognitive learning and co-learning mechanisms.

### Conclusion
- The paper emphasizes the potential of CL-XAI to facilitate cognitive learning with XAI, bridging knowledge disparities and empowering learners to understand complex concepts and problem-solving tasks.

### Critique
While the paper presents an intriguing concept and potential application of CL-XAI, several potential issues need consideration:
- The paper lacks specific results or empirical evidence from the application of the CL-XAI system, which limits the ability to assess its actual effectiveness.
- The evaluation framework proposed is based on subjective measures, and additional objective measures or real-world application results could strengthen the paper's argument.
- The discussion could benefit from addressing potential challenges or limitations of implementing the CL-XAI system in real-world educational or problem-solving settings.
- The potential implications and applications mentioned in the conclusion could be further elaborated with concrete examples or case studies to bolster the paper's claims.
