**Summary:**

The paper introduces Cambrian-1, a family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that adopt a vision-centric approach. The authors argue that the design choices for vision components in MLLMs are often insufficiently explored and disconnected from visual representation learning research, hindering accurate sensory grounding in real-world scenarios. The study uses LLMs and visual instruction tuning as an interface to evaluate various visual representations, offering new insights into different models and architectures. The authors critically examine existing MLLM benchmarks and introduce a new vision-centric benchmark, CV-Bench. They also propose the Spatial Vision Aggregator (SVA), a dynamic and spatially-aware connector that integrates high-resolution vision features with LLMs while reducing the number of tokens.

**Major Findings:**

1. The study reveals that most existing MLLM
