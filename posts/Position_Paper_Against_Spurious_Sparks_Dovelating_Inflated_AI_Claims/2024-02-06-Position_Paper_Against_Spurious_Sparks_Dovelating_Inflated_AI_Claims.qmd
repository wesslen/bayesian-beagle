### **Summary:**
In this position paper, the authors discuss the tendency to attribute human-like qualities to Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). They argue that the current search for AGI is prone to over-attributing human-like qualities to LLMs due to professional incentives, human biases, and methodological setups. The authors present several experiments to demonstrate that the discovery of human-interpretable patterns in latent spaces should not be a surprising outcome. They also call for the academic community to exercise extra caution in interpreting and communicating about AI research outcomes.

### Major Findings:
1. The authors argue that the current search for AGI is prone to over-attributing human-like qualities to LLMs due to professional incentives, human biases, and methodological setups.
2. Several experiments demonstrate that the discovery of human-interpretable patterns in latent spaces should not be a surprising outcome.
3. The authors call for the academic community to exercise extra caution in interpreting and communicating about AI research outcomes.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The authors provide a comprehensive and critical analysis of the current state of AI research, highlighting the potential biases and limitations in interpreting AI outcomes.
- They emphasize the need for rigorous testing and caution in attributing human-like qualities to AI systems, especially in the context of AGI.
- The paper raises important questions about the interpretation and communication of AI research outcomes, calling for a more nuanced and thorough approach to understanding the capabilities of AI systems.

Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the challenges and potential biases in AI research, emphasizing the need for critical evaluation and careful interpretation of AI outcomes.
