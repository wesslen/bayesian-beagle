### Summary:
- The article introduces the concept of National Alignment and presents the construction process and experiment results of KorNAT, emphasizing the need for LLMs to align with specific countries' cultures and knowledge.
- The experiments tested seven models for social value alignment and common knowledge alignment, revealing unique characteristics of each model and the models' tendencies to refrain from answering certain questions.
- The article discusses the process of generating questions using GPT-3.5-Turbo, survey information, survey filtering process, sampling theory, participant statistics, survey response statistics, response adjustment, social value dataset analysis, and examples of social value dataset.
- It also outlines the construction of a common knowledge dataset for various subjects, including the number of reference books used, the details of the dataset, the creation and revision guidelines, and a comparison with an existing knowledge dataset.
- The article provides examples of knowledge datasets in various subjects, including Korean, Social Studies, Korean History, and Common Sense, offering a diverse range of topics for educational and research purposes.
- The experiment environments, prompts used for the experiments, post-processing of the language models' generated responses, additional experiment results on social value alignment, human evaluation on social value alignment, and samples where only HyperCLOVA X correctly answered are detailed.
- The article describes the experiment setting for small language models (LMs) using a likelihood-based approach to evaluate their performance, highlighting the importance of fine-tuning language models on specific corpora.

### Major Findings:
1. The need for LLMs to align with specific countries' cultures and knowledge is emphasized.
2. Certain models exhibit higher alignment with the Korean population in terms of social values and common knowledge.
3. Fine-tuning language models on specific corpora enhances their understanding of social values and common knowledge.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article's findings underscore the importance of culturally aligned language models and the need for further improvement in LLMs' alignment with specific countries.
- The models' tendencies to refrain from answering certain questions raise questions about their ability to express opinions and align with societal sensitivities.
- The rigorous methodology and analysis involved in the survey process demonstrate the article's robust approach to data collection and analysis.
- The comparison of the common knowledge dataset with an existing dataset highlights the unique and valuable nature of the constructed dataset.
- The diverse range of topics covered in the knowledge datasets provides valuable resources for educational and research purposes.
- The experiment methodology and results contribute to a deeper understanding of the performance of language models and their alignment with social values and common knowledge.
