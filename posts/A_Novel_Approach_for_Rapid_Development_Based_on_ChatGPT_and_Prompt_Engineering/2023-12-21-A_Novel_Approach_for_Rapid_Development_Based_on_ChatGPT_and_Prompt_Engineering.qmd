### **Summary:**
The study explores the use of ChatGPT for code generation and introduces a novel approach called Prompt Engineering (PE) to optimize the code generation process. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of PE in enhancing the performance of ChatGPT in generating code. The results show significant improvements in various metrics, indicating the potential of ChatGPT for practical software development.

### Major Findings:
1. **Effectiveness of Prompt Builder:** The study utilized Prompt Builder to dynamically generate comprehensive prompts, resulting in significant improvements in metrics such as EM, BLEU, CodeBLEU, and Pass@1.
2. **Real Development Scenarios:** In real development scenarios, the study found that 98.5% of test cases can be validated through manual validation, highlighting the genuine assistance provided by the ChatGPT-based code generation approach.
3. **Web-Based Code Generation Platform:** The study developed a web-based code generation platform consisting of User Interface, Prompt Builder, and Backend Service, showcasing the practical application of ChatGPT for code generation.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the potential of ChatGPT for code generation and the effectiveness of Prompt Engineering in optimizing the code generation process. However, the study also highlights several limitations and challenges, including inherent limitations of ChatGPT, the need for standardization of prompts, and the complexity of multi-turn dialogues. Future research directions may focus on addressing these limitations and further improving the quality and efficiency of code generation using ChatGPT. Additionally, the study emphasizes the importance of integrating professional expertise with existing models to unlock their full potential.
