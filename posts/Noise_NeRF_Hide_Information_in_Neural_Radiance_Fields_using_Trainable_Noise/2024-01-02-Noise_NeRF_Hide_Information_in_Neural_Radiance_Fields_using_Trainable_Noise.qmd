### Main Findings

- **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)** has demonstrated potential in 3D reconstruction, with applications in virtual reality, augmented reality, and special effects games.
- The paper introduces **Noise-NeRF**, a novel steganography method based on trainable noise, which addresses challenges faced by NeRF steganography such as low steganographic quality, model weight damage, and limited steganographic information.
- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances in steganography quality, rendering quality, and efficiency, demonstrating effectiveness in super-resolution image steganography.

### Introduction
Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown potential in 3D reconstruction, but face concerns related to information confidentiality and data security. Prior studies on NeRF steganography have been limited, and existing approaches have displayed drawbacks including model weight damage and limited steganographic information.

### Proposed Method
The paper introduces Noise-NeRF, a steganography method based on trainable noise, which updates the input noise at a specific view without impacting the NeRF model's rendering quality. The Adaptive Pixel Selection strategy and Pixel Perturbation strategy are proposed to improve steganography quality and efficiency.

### Related Work
The success of NeRF has garnered widespread attention, while steganography for 2D images and explicit representation in 3D scenes has been extensively studied. Previous NeRF steganography methods have demonstrated limitations and challenges.

### Experiments
- **Multiple Scenes Steganography**: Noise-NeRF demonstrates consistent rendering quality with the standard NeRF and achieves superior steganography quality.
- **Super-resolution Steganography**: Noise-NeRF exhibits a 100% success rate in NeRF steganography for super-resolution images, highlighting its superiority in this domain.
- **Ablation Study**: The effectiveness of different components of Noise-NeRF is verified through an ablation study, emphasizing the importance of the proposed Adaptive Pixel Selection and Pixel Perturbation strategies.

### Conclusion
The paper introduces Noise-NeRF as a steganography method that addresses challenges faced by previous NeRF steganography approaches. The proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art performances in steganography quality, rendering quality, and effectiveness in super-resolution image steganography.

### Critique
While the paper presents a novel and effective method for NeRF steganography, potential concerns may include the need for further validation on diverse datasets and the consideration of potential vulnerabilities in real-world applications. Additionally, exploring potential limitations of Noise-NeRF in scenarios with complex scene structures could further enhance the comprehensiveness of the study.
