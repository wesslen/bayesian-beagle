### Summary:

This study evaluates the robustness of text-centric multimodal alignment methods, which convert diverse data types into text to facilitate the integration of various modalities. The authors reveal that current text-centric alignment methods can compromise downstream robustness due to the potential model collapse phenomenon, which can jeopardize the robustness of the aligned representation. To address this issue, the authors propose a new text-centric adversarial training approach that significantly enhances robustness compared to traditional robust training methods and pre-trained multimodal foundation models. The proposed method involves using a LLM-based perturbation module on top of the expert models to increase the diversity and robustness of text representations before converting different input modalities into text. The authors demonstrate that their enhancement can significantly improve the modality robustness through rigorous testing under various conditions, including missing or noisy data.

### Major Findings:

1. The study reveals that current text-centric alignment methods can compromise downstream robustness due to the potential model collapse phenomenon.
2. The authors propose a new text-centric adversarial training approach that significantly enhances robustness compared to traditional robust training methods and pre-trained multimodal foundation models.
3. The proposed method involves using a LLM-based perturbation module on top of the expert models to increase the diversity and robustness of text representations before converting different input modalities into text.
4. The authors demonstrate that their enhancement can significantly improve the modality robustness through rigorous testing under various conditions, including missing or noisy data.

### Analysis and Critique:

The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the robustness of text-centric multimodal alignment methods and propose a novel approach to enhance the robustness of these methods. However, the study does not provide a detailed comparison of the proposed method with other existing methods for improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Additionally, the study does not discuss the potential limitations of the proposed method, such as the computational cost of using a LLM-based perturbation module or the impact of the perturbation module on the quality of the text representations. Further research is needed to address these limitations and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world applications.
