### Summary:
- Conversational search engines use large language models (LLMs) to generate answers to queries.
- This paper investigates whether LLMs can be used to block generated native ads.
- The study compiles a large dataset of ad-prone queries and generated answers with automatically integrated ads to experiment with fine-tuned sentence transformers and state-of-the-art LLMs on the task of recognizing the ads.

### Major Findings:
1. Conversational search engines use LLMs to generate answers to queries.
2. LLMs can be used to block generated native ads.
3. The study compiles a large dataset of ad-prone queries and generated answers with automatically integrated ads to experiment with fine-tuned sentence transformers and state-of-the-art LLMs on the task of recognizing the ads.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study demonstrates that sentence transformers can be trained to identify generated native ads with high recall and precision scores.
- LLMs struggle with the task of recognizing ads, indicating potential limitations in their effectiveness.
- The study highlights that organic responses from search engines already contain advertising language, which may affect the precision of ad-blocking systems.
- The findings suggest the feasibility of generative native ads as well as the potential to defend against them on the client side.
