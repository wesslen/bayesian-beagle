### Summary:

- The study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to predict affective states in university students based on smartphone sensing data.
- The research aims to bridge the gap in utilizing LLMs for digital phenotyping tasks, specifically in integrating smartphone sensing data.
- The study investigates the relationship between behavioral features collected from smartphone sensors and the affects of university students.
- The study demonstrates the capability of zero-shot and few-shot embedding LLMs to infer affective states based on smartphone-captured human activities.
- The results suggest a discernible connection between smartphone-sensed activities of university students and their affective states, which LLMs interpret through their chains of thought.

### Major Findings:

1. LLMs can make promising predictions of affect measures using solely smartphone sensing data.
2. Zero-shot and few-shot embedding LLMs can infer general wellbeing based on smartphone sensing data.
3. LLMs can effectively predict affective states with minimal amounts of data, utilizing human behaviors and interactions with smartphones as input data.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The study is limited by the small sample size of 10 students, which may not be representative of the larger population.
- The study does not address potential biases in the data collection process or the self-reported measures used.
- The study does not discuss the potential ethical implications of using LLMs for digital phenotyping tasks.
- The study does not provide a comparison of the performance of LLMs with traditional machine learning models for affective state prediction.
- The study does not discuss the potential limitations of using LLMs for affective state prediction, such as the need for large amounts of training data and the potential for overfitting.
