### Summary:

The paper proposes a paradigm shift in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, focusing on their use as assistants to doctors rather than as replacements. The authors conduct a two-stage survey to identify the real needs of clinical doctors in their daily practice and build the DoctorFLAN dataset, containing about 92K samples covering 22 tasks in the entire workflow of doctors. The paper also develops the first expert-involved benchmark to evaluate LLMs in doctor-oriented scenarios with the single-turn DoctorFLAN-test and the multi-turn DotaBench.

### Major Findings:

1. The paper proposes a new paradigm for LLMs in healthcare, focusing on their use as assistants to doctors rather than as replacements.
2. The authors conduct a two-stage survey to identify the real needs of clinical doctors in their daily practice and build the DoctorFLAN dataset, containing about 92K samples covering 22 tasks in the entire workflow of doctors.
3. The paper develops the first expert-involved benchmark to evaluate LLMs in doctor-oriented scenarios with the single-turn DoctorFLAN-test and the multi-turn DotaBench.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel approach to the use of LLMs in healthcare, focusing on their use as assistants to doctors rather than as replacements. The authors' approach to identifying the real needs of clinical doctors through a two-stage survey and building the DoctorFLAN dataset is commendable. However, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed approach. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential impact of the proposed approach on the doctor-patient relationship and the potential ethical implications. The paper also does not provide a detailed comparison of the proposed approach with existing approaches in the field. Overall, the paper presents an interesting and novel approach to the use of LLMs in healthcare, but further research is needed to fully understand its potential impact and limitations.
