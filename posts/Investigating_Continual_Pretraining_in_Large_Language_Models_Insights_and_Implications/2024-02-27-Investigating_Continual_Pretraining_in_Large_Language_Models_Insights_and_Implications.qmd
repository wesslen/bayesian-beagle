### Summary:
This paper investigates Continual Learning (CL) in large language models (LLMs), focusing on continual domain-adaptive pretraining. The authors introduce a new benchmark to measure the adaptability of LLMs to evolving data environments and evaluate the impact of model size on learning efficacy and forgetting. The findings uncover several key insights, including the benefits of continual pretraining for domain specialization and knowledge transfer, as well as the sensitivity of smaller models to continual pretraining.

### Major Findings:
1. **Domain Specialization**: Continual pretraining enables LLMs to better specialize in the current domain compared to stand-alone fine-tuning when the sequence of domains shows semantic similarity.
2. **Knowledge Transfer**: Training across a diverse range of domains enhances both backward and forward knowledge transfer.
3. **Model Sensitivity**: Smaller models are particularly sensitive to continual pretraining, showing significant rates of both forgetting and learning.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study provides valuable insights into the benefits of continual pretraining for LLMs, particularly in terms of domain specialization and knowledge transfer.
- The findings suggest that semantic similarity between domains enhances the effectiveness of continual pretraining, but the study could benefit from further exploration of the impact of domain size and similarity on knowledge transfer.
- The study acknowledges limitations in the randomization of training domain order and suggests further investigation to validate the consistency of findings.
- The authors also highlight the potential risks of further pretraining a converged model and the need to rethink scaling laws for CL in LLMs.

Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive analysis of CL in LLMs, but further research is needed to address the identified limitations and validate the generalizability of the findings.
