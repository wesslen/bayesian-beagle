### Summary:
The article investigates whether large language models (LLMs) display rational reasoning by evaluating their performance on cognitive tasks from cognitive psychology literature. The study finds that LLMs display irrationality in these tasks, but the way this irrationality is displayed does not reflect that shown by humans. The LLMs reveal an additional layer of irrationality in the significant inconsistency of the responses. The paper seeks to make a methodological contribution by showing how we can assess and compare different capabilities of these types of models, in this case with respect to rational reasoning.

### Major Findings:
1. LLMs display irrationality in cognitive tasks, but the way this irrationality is displayed does not reflect that shown by humans.
2. The LLMs reveal an additional layer of irrationality in the significant inconsistency of the responses.
3. The study provides a methodological contribution by showing how we can assess and compare different capabilities of LLMs, particularly with respect to rational reasoning.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study highlights the inconsistency of responses given by LLMs, which raises concerns about their reliability and applicability in real-world scenarios.
- The findings suggest that LLMs may not accurately simulate human cognitive biases, which could limit their effectiveness in applications that require human-AI collaboration.
- The study does not address potential solutions or improvements to mitigate the identified shortcomings of LLMs, leaving room for further research in this area.
