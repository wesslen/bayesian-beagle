### **Key Findings**

1. **Federated Learning (FL)**, which collectively trains a global model without exchanging individual data samples, is a promising approach for training deep learning models in the context of wireless signal classification for NextG communications.

2. The paper discusses the vulnerability of FL systems to **poisoning attacks**, where malicious participants inject false or deceptive data into the model which can lead to biased or inaccurate results, and proposes a **proactive defense mechanism** to address this challenge.

3. The paper formulates the interactions between the attack and the defense as a **non-cooperative game** and quantifies the vulnerability and resilience of FL for NextG signal classification with respect to poisoning attacks, providing insights into novel operational modes that safeguard FL systems against such attacks.

### **I Introduction**

- **Challenges in NextG Communications:** NextG communications pose challenges for traditional analytical models, leading to the adoption of machine learning, particularly deep learning techniques.
- **Application of Federated Learning (FL):** FL is employed for spectrum sensing, where a signal classification model is trained using data collected from edge devices. This approach ensures privacy and reduces communication load.
- **Concerns about Vulnerabilities:** The increasing utilization of distributed clients makes FL systems susceptible to various exploits, attacks, and non-cooperative behaviors.

### **II Federated Learning for Distributed Spectrum Monitoring**

- FL involves the server distributing the global model architecture and model weight to clients, who train their local models and transmit them back to the server for aggregation.
- The model trained through FL is used for wireless signal classification and aims to identify BPSK or QPSK signals obtained from diverse locations.

### **III Attack and Defense for Federated Learning**

- The paper introduces the concept of poisoning attacks on FL and proposes a proactive defense approach focused on selecting clients for admission into the FL process to enhance the system's resilience.
- The defense mechanism involves a client admission policy that aims to exclude poisoned clients and include unpoisoned clients to improve system accuracy.

### **IV Poisoning Attack-Defense Game for Two Clients**

- The interactions between the attack and the defense are formulated as a non-cooperative game involving the selection of actions by the attack and the defense.
- The paper delves into the performance bounds, strategies, and utilities in Nash equilibrium for the attack and defense for scenarios involving two clients.

### **V Poisoning Attack-Defense Game for More Than Two Clients**

- The analysis is extended to accommodate an arbitrary number of clients, considering the best response of the attacker to the defender's strategy and the best response of the defender to the attacker's strategy.

### **VI Conclusion**

- The paper concludes by summarizing the contributions of the study in identifying resilient operation modes for FL and safeguarding it against poisoning attacks in NextG communication systems.

### **Critique and Potential Problems**

The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between poisoning attacks and defense mechanisms in FL systems for NextG communications. However, potential issues or limitations include:

- The complexity of the proposed game-theoretic solution and its practical implementation.
- The need for empirical validation of the proposed defense mechanism and its effectiveness in real-world FL systems.
- The potential impact of varying network conditions and client behaviors on the proposed game-theoretic model.
