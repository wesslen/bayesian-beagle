### Summary:
The article proposes a new framework, Culturally-aware Image Captioning (CIC), that generates captions and describes cultural elements extracted from cultural visual elements in images representing cultures. The framework generates questions based on cultural categories from images, extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA) using generated questions, and generates culturally-aware captions using Large Language Models (LLMs) with the prompts. The human evaluation conducted on 45 participants from 4 different cultural groups shows that the proposed framework generates more culturally descriptive captions when compared to the image captioning baseline based on Vision-Language Pre-trained models (VLPs).

### Major Findings:
1. The CIC framework generates culturally descriptive captions by extracting cultural visual elements from images representing different cultures.
2. The proposed framework outperforms existing image captioning models in generating culturally-aware captions for various cultural groups.
3. The human evaluation results demonstrate that the CIC framework is successful in generating culturally descriptive captions for different cultural groups.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article provides a comprehensive framework for generating culturally-aware image captions, addressing the limitations of existing methods.
- The proposed framework demonstrates significant improvements in generating culturally descriptive captions, as evidenced by the human evaluation results.
- However, the article acknowledges the need for additional cultural elements beyond the defined categories to accurately capture modern cultural images.
- The use of CLIPScore as a quantitative metric for assessing cultural competence is noted as a limitation, and the article suggests the need for a qualitative metric to assess cultural elements from image-text pairs.

Overall, the article presents a well-structured and coherent framework for generating culturally-aware image captions, with promising results from human evaluation. However, the article also highlights the need for further research to address the limitations and expand the framework to capture modern cultural images more accurately.
