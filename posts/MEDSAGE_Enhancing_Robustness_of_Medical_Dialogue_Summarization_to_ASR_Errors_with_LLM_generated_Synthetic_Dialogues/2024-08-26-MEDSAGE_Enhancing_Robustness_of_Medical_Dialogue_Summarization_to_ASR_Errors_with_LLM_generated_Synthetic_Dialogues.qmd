# Summary

The paper proposes MEDSAGE, an approach for generating synthetic samples for data augmentation using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the robustness of medical dialogue summarization to ASR errors. The authors leverage the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs and instruct them to generate ASR-like errors based on a few available medical dialogue examples with audio recordings. The experimental results show that LLMs can effectively model ASR noise, and incorporating this noisy data into the training process significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of medical dialogue summarization systems.

## Major Findings

1. LLMs can effectively model ASR noise, improving the robustness and accuracy of medical dialogue summarization systems.
2. Incorporating noisy data generated by LLMs into the training process significantly enhances the performance of medical dialogue summarization systems.
3. The proposed MEDSAGE approach addresses the challenges of noisy ASR outputs in critical applications, offering a robust solution to enhance the reliability of clinical dialogue summarization.

## Analysis and Critique

The paper presents a novel approach to address the challenges of noisy ASR outputs in medical dialogue summarization. The use of LLMs for generating synthetic samples for data augmentation is a promising solution to improve the robustness of summarization models. However, the paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other data augmentation techniques or error correction methods. Additionally, the evaluation is limited to a single dataset, and the generalizability of the proposed approach to other medical domains or languages remains to be explored. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness of MEDSAGE in real-world clinical settings and to address potential limitations and biases in the generated synthetic data.
