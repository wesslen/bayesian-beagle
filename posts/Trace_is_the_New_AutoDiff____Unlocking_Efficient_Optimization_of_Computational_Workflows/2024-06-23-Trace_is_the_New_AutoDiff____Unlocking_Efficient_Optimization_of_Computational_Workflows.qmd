**Summary:**

The paper introduces a new optimization framework called Trace, which is designed to optimize computational workflows in AI systems. The framework is inspired by back-propagation and treats the computational workflow as a graph, similar to neural networks. The optimization process involves rich feedback, heterogeneous parameters, and intricate objectives. The paper also introduces a new mathematical setup called Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO) to capture and abstract these properties, enabling the design of optimizers that work across multiple domains. The authors propose a general-purpose LLM-based optimizer called OptoPrime, which can effectively solve OPTO problems. Empirical studies show that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, and more. The authors believe that Trace, OptoPrime, and the OPTO framework will enable the next generation of interactive agents that automatically adapt using various kinds of feedback.

**Major Findings:**

1. The Trace framework is an end-to-end optimization approach for computational workflows, inspired by back-propagation.
2. Trace treats a computational workflow as a computational graph, similar to a neural network, and propagates the execution trace instead of gradients.
3. The authors introduce a new mathematical setup called Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO) to capture and abstract the properties of computational workflow optimization.
4. The authors propose a general-purpose LLM-based optimizer called OptoPrime, which can effectively solve OPTO problems.
5. Empirical studies show that OptoPrime is capable of various optimization tasks, including first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, and code debugging.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper presents an interesting and novel approach to optimizing computational workflows in AI systems. The Trace framework and the OPTO mathematical setup provide a new perspective on how to optimize complex workflows, and the proposed OptoPrime optimizer demonstrates promising results in various optimization tasks. However, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison with existing optimization techniques, which could help to better understand the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the scalability and
