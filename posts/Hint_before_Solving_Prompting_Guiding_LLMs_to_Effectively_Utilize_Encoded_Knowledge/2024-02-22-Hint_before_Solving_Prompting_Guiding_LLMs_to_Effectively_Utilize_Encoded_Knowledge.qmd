### Summary:
The article introduces the Hint-before-Solving Prompting (HSP) method, which guides Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate hints before solving problems. The article presents extensive experimental results demonstrating that HSP can effectively improve the accuracy of reasoning tasks, especially in mathematical and common sense reasoning. The results show that HSP can guide LLMs to autonomously generate helpful hints, even for challenging tasks, and that supervised fine-tuning on HSP format datasets can significantly improve LLMs' performance.

### Major Findings:
1. HSP can effectively guide LLMs to generate hints containing specific knowledge, pivotal concepts, or analytical insights critical for solving problems before attempting to solve them.
2. High-quality hints can significantly improve the performance of LLMs, especially in mathematical reasoning tasks.
3. HSP can work on hard tasks, and under the self-consistency setting, it can improve performance on samples with difficult topics or hard levels.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article provides extensive experimental results to support the effectiveness of HSP, demonstrating its robustness across diverse example sets and its ability to improve LLMs' reasoning capability and reduce the length of solutions.
- The article acknowledges limitations in computational resources and dataset construction, indicating areas for future research and improvement.
- The article provides a comprehensive comparison of reimplemented results with existing work, ensuring the validity and reliability of the findings.
- The critical analysis highlights the potential impact and implications of HSP on LLMs' reasoning processes, indicating the significance of the research in advancing the capabilities of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks.
