### **Summary:**
- Large Language Models (LLMs) are facing constraints due to limitations in GPU memory and computational speed.
- Weight compression methods like Pruning and Quantization have emerged to address these constraints.
- The proposed Data-free Joint Rank-k Approximation method achieves a model pruning of 80% parameters while retaining 93.43% of the original performance without any calibration data.

### Major Findings:
1. The proposed Data-free Joint Rank-k Approximation method achieves a model pruning of 80% parameters while retaining 93.43% of the original performance without any calibration data.
2. Joint Rank-k Approximation outperforms separately conducted Rank-k Approximation in the attention module and feed-forward module of large language models.
3. Rank-k Approximation helps in denoising weight matrices, potentially improving the modelâ€™s robustness and performance.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The paper provides a novel approach to weight compression in large language models, but it may require further validation on a wider range of datasets and models.
- The experiments conducted are limited to specific models and datasets, and the generalizability of the proposed method needs to be further explored.
- The potential biases and limitations of the proposed method, especially in real-world applications, need to be thoroughly investigated.
