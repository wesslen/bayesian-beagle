# Summary:

The paper presents a comprehensive study of the ChatGPT app ecosystem, focusing on the distribution, deployment, and security of plugins. The study aims to illuminate the landscape of the ecosystem for the research community. The authors collect and analyze all currently available plugins from the store (overall 1,038) and categorize them based on their functionality. They also investigate the deployment and execution models of the plugins through reverse engineering. The study reveals an uneven distribution of functionality among ChatGPT plugins, highlighting prevalent and emerging topics. However, the authors also identify severe flaws in the authentication and user data protection for third-party app APIs integrated within LLMs, revealing a concerning status quo of security and privacy in this app ecosystem.

# Major Findings:

1. The study reveals an uneven distribution of functionality among ChatGPT plugins, with more than half of the plugins concentrated in five categories: data & research, tools, developer & code, business, and entertainment.
2. The authors identify severe flaws in the authentication and user data protection for third-party app APIs integrated within LLMs, revealing a concerning status quo of security and privacy in this app ecosystem.
3. The study provides insights for the secure and sustainable development of this rapidly evolving ecosystem.

# Analysis and Critique:

The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the ChatGPT app ecosystem, highlighting the potential of this ecosystem to offer personalized AI services and establish ChatGPT as the backbone of an open app ecosystem. However, the authors also identify several critical issues that need to be addressed to ensure the security and privacy of this ecosystem. The lack of well-labeled data and the black-box nature of LLMs make it challenging to accurately capture and interpret the runtime workflow and data flow. The study also reveals a concerning prevalence of security and privacy flaws among ChatGPT plugins. The authors suggest that the ChatGPT app ecosystem is still in its nascent stage and lacks a mature regulatory mechanism to enforce user privacy compliance and security standards. The study not only contributes to the improvement of the current store but also provides insights into the future development of the entire ecosystem.
