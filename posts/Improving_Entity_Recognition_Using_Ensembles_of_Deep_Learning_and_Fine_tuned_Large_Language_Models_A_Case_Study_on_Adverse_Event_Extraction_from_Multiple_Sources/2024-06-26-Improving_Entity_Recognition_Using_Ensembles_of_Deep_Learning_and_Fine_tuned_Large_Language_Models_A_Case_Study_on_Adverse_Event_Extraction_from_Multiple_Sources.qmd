**Summary:**

This study evaluates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) and traditional deep learning models in adverse event (AE) extraction following COVID-19 vaccines. The authors utilized reports and posts from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), Twitter, and Reddit as their corpora. Their goal was to extract three types of entities: vaccine, shot, and adverse event (ae). They explored and fine-tuned multiple LLMs, including GPT-2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama-2 7b, and Llama-2 13b, as well as traditional deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT). To enhance performance, they created ensembles of the three models with the best performance. The ensemble model achieved the highest performance in "vaccine," "shot," and "ae," with strict F1-scores of 0.878, 0.930, and 0.925, respectively, along with a micro-average score of 0.903. These results underscore the significance of fine-tuning models for specific tasks and demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble methods in enhancing performance.

**Major Findings:**

1. Fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs, such as GPT-2 and GPT-3.5, played a pivotal role in enhancing their ability to recognize entities related to AEs.
2. Llama models exhibited more noticeable differences in performance, which can be attributed to their specialized architecture and training objectives for medical NLP tasks.
3. Ensembling fine-tuned LLMs with traditional deep learning models for the NER task related to AEs following COVID-19 vaccination from social media posts significantly improved the strict F1 score, exceeding 90%.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The study demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of ensembling fine-tuned traditional deep learning models and LLMs for extracting AE-related information following COVID-19 vaccination. However, the authors acknowledge that the corpora
