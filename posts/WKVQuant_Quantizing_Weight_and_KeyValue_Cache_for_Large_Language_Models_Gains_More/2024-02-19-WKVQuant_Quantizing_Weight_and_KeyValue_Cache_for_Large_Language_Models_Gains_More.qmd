### Summary:
The article discusses the challenges faced by Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their substantial memory requirements and computational demands. The authors propose WKVQuant, a Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) framework designed for quantizing weights and the key/value (KV) cache of LLMs. The proposed framework incorporates past-only quantization to improve the computation of attention, two-dimensional quantization strategy to handle the distribution of KV cache, and cross-block reconstruction regularization for parameter optimization. The experiments demonstrate that WKVQuant achieves almost comparable memory savings to weight-activation quantization while approaching the performance of weight-only quantization.

### Major Findings:
1. WKVQuant achieves almost comparable memory savings to weight-activation quantization while approaching the performance of weight-only quantization.
2. The proposed framework incorporates past-only quantization to improve the computation of attention.
3. Two-dimensional quantization strategy is introduced to handle the distribution of KV cache.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The proposed WKVQuant provides a promising trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for LLMs.
- The exclusive quantization of weights and KV cache is a beneficial trade-off between retaining model accuracy and achieving memory savings.
- The proposed methods, such as past-only quantization and two-dimensional quantization, significantly contribute to the performance of the quantized LLMs.
- The cross-block reconstruction regularization is effective in optimizing the parameters for quantization.

The article provides a comprehensive analysis of the challenges faced by LLMs and proposes an effective solution in the form of WKVQuant. The proposed framework addresses the limitations of existing quantization approaches and demonstrates promising results in terms of memory savings and performance. However, the article could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential limitations and future research directions.
