### Summary:
The rise of generative artificial intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has intensified the imperative to scrutinize fairness alongside accuracy. Recent studies have begun to investigate fairness evaluations for LLMs within domains such as recommendations. Given that personalization is an intrinsic aspect of recommendation systems, its incorporation into fairness assessments is paramount. Yet, the degree to which current fairness evaluation frameworks account for personalization remains unclear. This comprehensive literature review aims to fill this gap by examining how existing frameworks handle fairness evaluations of LLMs, with a focus on the integration of personalization factors. Despite an exhaustive collection and analysis of relevant works, most evaluations overlook personalization, a critical facet of recommendation systems, thereby inadvertently perpetuating unfair practices. 

### Major Findings:
1. Fairness evaluations for LLMs overlook personalization, a critical facet of recommendation systems, perpetuating unfair practices.
2. Existing fairness evaluation frameworks for LLMs in music and movie recommendation systems do not adequately account for personalization factors.
3. Metrics used in fairness evaluations of LLMs do not effectively address potential biases arising from personalization in recommendation systems.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides a comprehensive review of the integration of personality profiling into Large Language Models (LLMs) for music and movie recommendations. It highlights the potential of personality profiling to mitigate bias and promote equity in recommendations. However, the article also identifies several challenges, including data bias, limited control and explainability, user acceptance and trust, scalability and efficiency, and ethical considerations. The authors propose future work to address these challenges, such as developing fairness evaluation frameworks, integrating personality profiling, and exploring bias mitigation techniques. The article provides a roadmap for advancing fairness in LLM-based recommendations and emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations and user well-being.
