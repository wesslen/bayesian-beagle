### Summary:

The paper introduces a BIlingual PEDagogically-informed Tutoring Dataset (BIPED) for developing Conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems (CITS) capable of teaching complex concepts in English as a Second Language (ESL). The dataset consists of one-on-one, human-to-human English tutoring interactions, which are annotated with a lexicon of dialogue acts, including 34 tutor acts and 9 student acts. The authors propose a two-step framework for implementing CITS, which involves predicting the appropriate tutor act and generating the corresponding response. They experimentally demonstrate that the implemented models can replicate the style of human teachers and employ diverse and contextually appropriate pedagogical strategies.

### Major Findings:

1. The BIPED dataset is a valuable resource for developing CITS that can teach complex ESL concepts using pedagogically meaningful teaching strategies.
2. The two-step framework for implementing CITS, which involves predicting the appropriate tutor act and generating the corresponding response, has been shown to be effective in replicating the style of human teachers and employing diverse and contextually appropriate pedagogical strategies.
3. The implemented models, based on GPT-4 and SOLAR-KO, have been experimentally demonstrated to be capable of mimicking human teacher's utterance style and their pedagogical strategies.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of CITS by introducing a dataset and a framework for developing CITS that can teach complex ESL concepts.
2. The proposed two-step framework for implementing CITS is a promising approach, but it may require further validation and refinement to ensure its generalizability to other contexts and languages.
3. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed models, which could be an area for future research.
4. The paper does not discuss the potential ethical implications of using CITS for teaching ESL, such as the impact on human teachers and the potential for perpetuating biases in language learning.
5. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the proposed models with other existing CITS, which could be an area for future research.

Overall, the paper provides a
