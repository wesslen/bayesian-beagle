# Summary:

The paper "MM-Forecast: A Multimodal Approach to Temporal Event Forecasting with Large Language Models" (2024) explores the emerging problem of multimodal temporal event forecasting using large language models (LLMs). The authors identify two essential functions of images in this context: highlighting and complementary. They propose a novel framework, MM-Forecast, which employs an Image Function Identification module to recognize these functions using multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and incorporate them into LLM-based forecasting models. The proposed method is evaluated on a new multimodal dataset, MidEast-TE-mm, constructed by extending an existing event dataset with images. The results demonstrate that MM-Forecast can accurately identify image functions and significantly improve forecasting performance.

## Major Findings:

1. The study identifies two essential functions of images in temporal event forecasting: highlighting and complementary.
2. The proposed MM-Forecast framework recognizes these functions using MLLMs and integrates them into LLM-based forecasting models.
3. The evaluation of MM-Forecast on the MidEast-TE-mm dataset shows that it can accurately identify image functions and improve forecasting performance.

## Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper addresses an important and emerging problem in the field of temporal event forecasting, namely the integration of visual information into LLM-based models.
2. The proposed MM-Forecast framework is a promising approach to address this problem, as it leverages the superior multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
3. The evaluation of MM-Forecast on the MidEast-TE-mm dataset provides empirical evidence of its effectiveness in improving forecasting performance.
4. However, the paper does not discuss potential limitations or challenges in applying the proposed method to other datasets or domains.
5. The paper also does not provide a detailed comparison of MM-Forecast with other existing methods for temporal event forecasting.
6. Future research could explore the generalizability of MM-Forecast to other datasets and domains, as well as compare its performance with other state-of-the-art methods.
