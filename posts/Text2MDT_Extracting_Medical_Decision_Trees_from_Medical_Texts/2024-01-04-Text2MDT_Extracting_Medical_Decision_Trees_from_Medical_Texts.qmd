# Summary of "Text2MDT: Extracting Medical Decision Trees from Medical Texts"

## Major Takeaways
1. **Text2MDT**: The paper proposes a novel task, **Text2MDT**, which aims to automatically extract **medical decision trees (MDTs)** from medical texts such as medical guidelines and textbooks. This is significant for the development of clinical decision support systems.
2. **End-to-end vs. Pipeline Framework**: The paper investigates both an end-to-end framework and a pipeline framework for the Text2MDT task and demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) show promising results in automated MDT extraction.
3. **Open-Sourced Dataset and Source Code**: The study contributes to the field by constructing the first Text2MDT benchmark dataset and making it openly available to facilitate further research.


## Introduction
- The development of clinical decision support systems, which rely on medical decision processes modeled as MDTs, has drawn significant attention in the medical field.
- Current methods for constructing MDTs rely on manual tree construction, which is time-consuming and laborious, leading to a need for automated pipelines for precise MDT extraction. This motivates the proposal of the Text2MDT task.

## Text2MDT Task
- **Structure**: The knowledge of a medical decision process embedded in the medical text is modeled as a binary decision tree consisting of condition nodes and decision nodes, linked by the logical relationships 

## Data Collection and Evaluation
- **Data Collection**: A Text2MDT dataset was constructed using clinical practice guidelines and clinical medicine textbooks, and medical practitioners evaluated the ability of medical texts and decision trees to represent the medical decision process.
- **Manual Evaluation**: The quality of the annotated MDTs was evaluated by medical practitioners and individuals without a medical background.

## Methods of modeling Text2MDT
- **Pipelined Framework**: The study investigates triplet extraction, node grouping, and tree assembling as subtasks for the pipeline framework. Both encoder-based and LLM-based methods are explored.
- **End-to-end Framework**: The paper proposes various COT-style generation methods for the end-to-end framework, considering the complexity of the Text2MDT task and the potential benefit of COT reasoning.

## Experiments and Results
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The study uses metrics such as triplet precision, recall, and F1 scores for triplet extraction, edit distance-based metrics for node grouping, and additional metrics for tree assembling.
- **Performance Findings**: The study shows competitive results for MedBERT-based methods and demonstrates the potential of COT-style reasoning in improving the performance of generative LMs on the Text2MDT task.

## Limitations and Critique
- The study acknowledges limitations related to the expressiveness of the tree, limited logic expression of nodes, and text length constraints. Further improvements are identified as future work.

## Conclusion
- The paper concludes with the significance of the proposed Text2MDT task for automated extraction of MDTs and highlights the contributions of the study, including the construction of the Text2MDT dataset and the exploration of novel method frameworks.
- Additionally, the study identifies potential future work to address the limitations and challenges encountered in the investigation.

## Critique
The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the Text2MDT task and presents valuable contributions to the field of automated MDT extraction. However, a more detailed discussion of potential challenges and future directions for improving the proposed methods would enhance the paper's completeness. Additionally, addressing the limitations of the proposed framework and its applicability in real-world clinical settings would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the study's contributions.
