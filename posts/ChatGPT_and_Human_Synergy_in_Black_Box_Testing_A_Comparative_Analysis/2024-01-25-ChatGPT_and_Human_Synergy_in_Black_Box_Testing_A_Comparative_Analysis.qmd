**Summary:**

The article explores the utilization of large language models (LLMs), particularly ChatGPT, in black-box testing. The authors compared the test cases created by ChatGPT (GPT-4) and human participants for three applications to evaluate their real-world applicability and understand how ChatGPT could enhance human testing strategies. The findings indicate that ChatGPT can generate test cases that are comparable to or slightly better than those created by human participants in terms of test viewpoint coverage. Furthermore, when collaborating with humans, ChatGPT can cover more test viewpoints than either can alone. However, the study also identified certain issues with the test cases generated by ChatGPT that need addressing.

### Major Findings:
1. ChatGPT can generate test cases that match or slightly surpass those created by human participants, particularly in terms of test viewpoint coverage.
2. Collaboration between humans and ChatGPT can lead to considerably more test viewpoints being covered than if humans work alone.
3. The study identified specific issues with the test cases generated by ChatGPT, suggesting that certain improvements are necessary before their use in practice.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article effectively highlights the potential of ChatGPT in enhancing black-box testing and emphasizes the benefits of collaboration between ChatGPT and humans. However, the study also pointed out some limitations of ChatGPT, such as overlooking test viewpoints related to boundary values and experiencing batch size limitations. Additionally, inconsistencies between the test case descriptions formulated by ChatGPT and the corresponding input values, test procedures, and expected outcomes were noted. These limitations call for further improvement and refinement of ChatGPT's black-box testing capabilities. Furthermore, the article does not address the potential biases or limitations in the selection of human participants, which could impact the comparative analysis. It is essential for future research to address these limitations to ensure the practical applicability of ChatGPT in black-box testing.
