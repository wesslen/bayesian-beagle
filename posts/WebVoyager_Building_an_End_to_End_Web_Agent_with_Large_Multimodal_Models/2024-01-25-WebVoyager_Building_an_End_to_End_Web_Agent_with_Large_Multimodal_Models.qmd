**Summary:**

The article introduces WebVoyager, an autonomous web agent powered by Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that can interact with real-world websites, complete user instructions, and is evaluated using a new protocol for web agents. The main contributions of the article include proposing an innovative web agent that integrates textual and visual information to handle end-to-end web tasks, creating an online web browsing environment, and conducting manual and automated evaluations using GPT-4V.

### Major Findings:
1. WebVoyager achieves a 55.7% task success rate in completing user instructions, outperforming both GPT-4 (All Tools) and the text-only setup.
2. The proposed automatic evaluation using GPT-4V shows 85.3% agreement with human judgment, indicating the reliability and potential for further use in evaluating web agents' performance.
3. The article highlights the necessity of both text and visual information for building general-purpose web agents and the importance of directly interacting with websites for completing certain types of tasks.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the development and evaluation of a multimodal web agent, showcasing its potential for real-world applications. However, some limitations and areas for further research are apparent:

- **Limited Evaluation Dataset:** The evaluation dataset, though comprehensive, does not cover websites that require login or CAPTCHA, limiting the generalizability of WebVoyager's performance in real-world scenarios.

- **Text-Heavy Websites:** The article acknowledges that WebVoyager struggles with text-heavy websites, indicating a potential area for future improvement to enhance text recognition capabilities.

- **Incomplete Feature Support:** The web agent's limited support for actions such as the Drag action and video processing highlights the need for further development to achieve more comprehensive web browsing capabilities.

- **Reliance on Bing Search:** The limitation of GPT-4 (All Tools) in accessing certain websites directly suggests the need for enhanced capabilities to directly interact with various websites for a more robust performance.

In conclusion, while the article presents a significant advancement in the development and evaluation of multimodal web agents, it also underscores the need for further improvements to tackle the challenges of effectively handling both textual and visual information and achieving comprehensive feature support for real-world web browsing. Additionally, addressing biases in the evaluation dataset and improving the agent's ability to interact with a broader range of websites would further enhance the applicability of WebVoyager in real-world scenarios.
