### Summary:

This paper presents a comprehensive study of the side effects associated with existing knowledge editing techniques in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors discuss related works and summarize potential research directions to overcome these limitations. The paper highlights the limitations of current knowledge editing methods, emphasizing the need for deeper understanding of inner knowledge structures of LLMs and improved knowledge editing methods.

### Major Findings:

1. Knowledge editing in LLMs can have unintended side effects, such as knowledge distortion and the deterioration of general abilities, that have emerged after editing.
2. Current knowledge editing methods struggle with making logical inferences based on the edited facts, introducing unintended alterations of non-target knowledge and deterioration in model performance, particularly with parameter-modified methods.
3. Editing techniques that leverage information retrieval can mitigate deviations in model abilities by keeping model parameters intact.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the side effects associated with existing knowledge editing techniques, but it does not offer a clear solution to these issues.
2. The authors discuss the limitations of current knowledge editing methods, but they do not provide a detailed comparison of these methods or a clear recommendation for the best approach.
3. The paper highlights the need for deeper understanding of inner knowledge structures of LLMs, but it does not provide a clear roadmap for achieving this goal.
4. The paper does not discuss the potential ethical implications of knowledge editing in LLMs, such as the risk of introducing biases or manipulating information.
5. The paper does not provide a clear evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed research directions for overcoming the limitations of current knowledge editing methods.
