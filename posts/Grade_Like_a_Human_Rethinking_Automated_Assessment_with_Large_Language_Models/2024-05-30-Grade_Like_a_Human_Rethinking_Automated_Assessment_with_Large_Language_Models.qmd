### Summary:

- The paper proposes an LLM-based grading system that addresses the entire grading procedure, including rubric generation, grading, and post-grading review.
- The system aims to provide accurate and consistent scores for each student, along with customized feedback, and conduct post-grading review to ensure accuracy and fairness.
- The authors collected a new dataset named OS from a university operating system course and conducted extensive experiments on both the OS dataset and the widely used Mohler dataset.
- The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing new insights for developing automated grading systems based on LLMs.

### Major Findings:

1. The proposed LLM-based grading system addresses the entire grading procedure, including rubric generation, grading, and post-grading review.
2. The system provides accurate and consistent scores for each student, along with customized feedback, and conducts post-grading review to ensure accuracy and fairness.
3. The authors collected a new dataset named OS from a university operating system course and conducted extensive experiments on both the OS dataset and the widely used Mohler dataset.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The paper provides a comprehensive approach to automated grading using LLMs, addressing the entire grading procedure.
- The use of a new dataset, OS, from a university operating system course, provides a valuable resource for research in automated grading.
- The experiments conducted on both the OS dataset and the Mohler dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
- However, the paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed approach, such as the potential for bias in the LLM-generated rubrics or the need for human oversight in the grading process.
- Additionally, the paper does not provide a comparison with other automated grading systems, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
