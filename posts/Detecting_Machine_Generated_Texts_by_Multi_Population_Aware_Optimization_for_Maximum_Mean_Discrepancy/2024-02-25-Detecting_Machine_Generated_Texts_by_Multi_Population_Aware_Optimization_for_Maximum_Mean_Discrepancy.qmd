In summary, our proposed MMD-MP method has demonstrated superior performance in detecting machine-generated texts (MGTs) compared to existing methods. The method effectively addresses the challenges of training deep kernel-based MMD with data from multiple populations, leading to more stable discrepancy estimation and improved detection capabilities. However, there are still opportunities for further research to explore the theoretical underpinnings of these findings and to address the issue of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) text data in paragraph-based detection. These future directions will contribute to the continued advancement of MGT detection techniques.
