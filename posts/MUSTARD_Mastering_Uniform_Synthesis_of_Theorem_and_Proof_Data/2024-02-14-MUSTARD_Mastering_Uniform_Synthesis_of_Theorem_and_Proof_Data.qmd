### Summary:
Mustard is a data generation framework that focuses on synthesizing high-quality and diverse theorem and proof data. It samples mathematical concept seeds, prompts a generative language model to obtain problems and their step-wise formal solutions, and utilizes a proof assistant to filter the valid proofs. The resulting MustardSauce benchmark contains 5,866 validated data points. Extensive analysis and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Mustard in generating validated high-quality step-by-step data. The fine-tuned Llama 2-7B achieves significant average relative performance gains in automated theorem proving and math word problems.

### Major Findings:
1. Mustard introduces a data generation framework that uniformly synthesizes large-scale and high-quality mathematical data by combining the advantages of LLMs in verbalization and formal theorem provers in rigorous data validation.
2. MustardSauce, the resulting benchmark, contains both math word problems and theorem-proving problems spanning over four educational levels, with each sample having corresponding informal and formal solutions.
3. The fine-tuned Llama 2-7B achieves significant improvements in automated theorem proving and math word problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of MustardSauce in improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of language models.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The Mustard framework effectively addresses the challenges of obtaining high-quality mathematical data, but there may still be potential biases introduced by the sampled concepts and domains.
- The use of a proof assistant for validation is a significant strength of the framework, but there may be room for more rigorous and careful data filtering.
- The study demonstrates the effectiveness of MustardSauce in improving language models' mathematical reasoning performance, but further research is needed to explore the scalability and potential biases in the generated data.
