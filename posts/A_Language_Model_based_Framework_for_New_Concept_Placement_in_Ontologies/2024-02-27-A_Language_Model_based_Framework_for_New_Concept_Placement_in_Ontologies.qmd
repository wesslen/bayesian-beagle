### **Summary:**
- The article investigates the task of inserting new concepts from texts into an ontology using language models.
- The proposed approach consists of three steps: edge search, edge formation and enrichment, and edge selection, leveraging neural methods and pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as BERT and Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT series, FLAN-T5, and Llama 2.
- The methods are evaluated on datasets created using the SNOMED CT ontology and the MedMentions entity linking benchmark, showing the advantages of PLMs and the encouraging performance of LLMs.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The best settings in the proposed framework use fine-tuned PLMs for search and a multi-label Cross-encoder for selection.
2. Zero-shot prompting of LLMs is still not adequate for the task, and explainable instruction tuning of LLMs is proposed for improved performance.
3. Results indicate that edge enrichment by leveraging the structure of ontology greatly improves the performance of new concept placement.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The article provides a comprehensive framework for ontology concept placement, leveraging both PLMs and LLMs. However, the limitations of zero-shot prompting for LLMs and the need for explainable instruction tuning highlight the challenges in leveraging LLMs for this task.
- The study's focus on ontology concept placement and the evaluation on specific datasets limit the generalizability of the findings to other domains or ontologies.
- The article does not address potential biases or limitations of using language models for ontology concept placement, which could impact the accuracy and reliability of the proposed framework.
