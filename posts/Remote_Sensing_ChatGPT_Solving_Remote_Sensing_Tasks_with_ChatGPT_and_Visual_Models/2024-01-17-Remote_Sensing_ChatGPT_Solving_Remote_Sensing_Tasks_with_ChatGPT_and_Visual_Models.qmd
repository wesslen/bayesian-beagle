### **Summary:**
The article introduces Remote Sensing ChatGPT, an agent powered by large language models (LLM) that utilizes ChatGPT to connect various AI-based remote sensing models to solve complicated interpretation tasks. The lack of automation in remote sensing task planning hinders the accessibility of remote sensing interpretation techniques, especially to non-remote sensing experts from multiple research fields. Remote Sensing ChatGPT aims to address this issue by understanding user requests, performing task planning, executing subtasks iteratively, and generating the final response according to the output of each subtask. The system is publicly available and can tackle a wide range of remote sensing tasks.

### Major Findings:
1. Remote Sensing ChatGPT is an LLM-powered agent that can understand usersâ€™ requests, plan remote sensing interpretation tasks, and generate final products and responses to users.
2. The system utilizes ChatGPT to generate a prompt template, perform task planning, and execute subtasks iteratively to solve complex interpretation tasks.
3. Experiments and examples show that Remote Sensing ChatGPT can tackle a wide range of remote sensing tasks and can be extended to more tasks with more sophisticated models.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article presents a novel approach to automating remote sensing interpretation tasks using LLMs and ChatGPT. However, the study has limitations, such as the lack of quantitative evaluation of the interpretation accuracy and the reliance on human intervention for defining essential tasks. Additionally, the article acknowledges some failure cases, including unsupported categories of existing remote sensing models and the system's tendency to imagine the answer rather than ask for more information. Further research is needed to address these limitations and improve the performance of Remote Sensing ChatGPT.
