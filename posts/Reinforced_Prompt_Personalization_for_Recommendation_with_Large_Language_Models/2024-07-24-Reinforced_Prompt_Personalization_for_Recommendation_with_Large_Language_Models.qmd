### Summary:

The paper introduces the concept of instance-wise prompting to personalize discrete prompts for individual users in recommendation tasks. The authors propose Reinforced Prompt Personalization (RPP) to optimize the four patterns in prompts using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). RPP enhances efficiency by formulating prompt personalization as selecting optimal sentences holistically across the four patterns, rather than optimizing word-by-word. The authors also propose RPP+ to enhance the scalability of action space by dynamically refining actions with LLMs throughout the iterative process. The effectiveness of RPP/RPP+ is evaluated in ranking tasks over various datasets, demonstrating their superiority over traditional recommender models, few-shot methods, and other prompt-based methods.

### Major Findings:

1. The paper introduces the concept of instance-wise prompting to personalize discrete prompts for individual users in recommendation tasks.
2. Reinforced Prompt Personalization (RPP) is proposed to optimize the four patterns in prompts using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).
3. RPP enhances efficiency by formulating prompt personalization as selecting optimal sentences holistically across the four patterns, rather than optimizing word-by-word.
4. RPP+ is proposed to enhance the scalability of action space by dynamically refining actions with LLMs throughout the iterative process.
5. The effectiveness of RPP/RPP+ is evaluated in ranking tasks over various datasets, demonstrating their superiority over traditional recommender models, few-shot methods, and other prompt-based methods.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel approach to personalizing prompts for individual users in recommendation tasks using instance-wise prompting. The proposed Reinforced Prompt Personalization (RPP) and RPP+ methods offer promising results in enhancing the efficiency and scalability of action space. However, the following points should be considered for future research:

1. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of RPP and RPP+, making it difficult to determine the specific advantages and disadvantages of each method.
2. The evaluation of RPP/RPP+ is limited to ranking tasks, and their performance in other recommendation tasks, such as rating prediction or item recommendation, remains unex
