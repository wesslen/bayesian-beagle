**Summary:**

- The Modular Ontology Modeling (MOMo) methodology aims to mimic human analogical process using modular patterns for assembling complex concepts.
- A new collection of 104 ontology design patterns (ODPs) is presented, representing often occurring nouns, curated from common-sense knowledge available in Large Language Models (LLMs).
- The ODPs are organized into a fully-annotated modular ontology design library (CS-MODL), ready for use with MOMo, supporting accelerated ontology development for both human and automated processes.

**Major Findings:**

1. A new collection of 104 ODPs is developed, representing often occurring nouns, curated from common-sense knowledge available in LLMs.
2. The ODPs are organized into a fully-annotated modular ontology design library (CS-MODL), which is ready for use with MOMo.
3. The CS-MODL supports accelerated ontology development for both human and automated processes, addressing a major bottleneck in large-scale deployment of MOMo.

**Analysis and Critique:**

- The selection of the 104 most common nouns in American English may not be representative of all domains or languages.
- The study relies on the performance of a specific LLM (GPT-4-0613), and results might vary with other models.
- The evaluation of the CS-MODL is limited to a single case study, which may not fully demonstrate its potential.
- The paper does not discuss potential ethical implications of using LLMs as a source of common knowledge, such as biases learned during training.

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of ontology engineering by introducing a collection of ODPs and a modular ontology design library (CS-MODL) that can support accelerated ontology development for both human and automated processes. However, there are limitations to consider, such as the representativeness of the selected nouns, the reliance on a specific LLM, and the limited evaluation. Additionally, ethical implications of using LLMs as a source of common knowledge should be discussed further.
