### Summary:

The article investigates the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in handling tasks that require temporal knowledge and understanding. It evaluates the abilities of LLMs in the context of temporal knowledge retrieval and processing, highlighting their low performance on detailed questions about the past and rather new information. The study also experiments with different time-referencing schemes and the corruption of time references to understand the extent to which LLMs can effectively address the challenges associated with temporal knowledge management. The findings emphasize the need for future models to better cater to temporally-oriented tasks and address the temporal blind spots observed in LLMs.

### Major Findings:
1. Large language models (LLMs) exhibit low performance on detailed questions about the past and surprisingly for rather new information.
2. LLMs struggle to answer questions about the past and lack knowledge of specific details of past events.
3. The prevalence of temporal errors and the negative effects of using relative time referencing highlight the need to enhance LLMs' temporal comprehension capabilities.

### Analysis and Critique:
The findings of the study provide valuable insights into the limitations of LLMs in handling tasks that require temporal knowledge and understanding. The results have implications for the development of more effective language models that can address the temporal blind spots observed in LLMs. However, the study could benefit from further exploration of potential biases, methodological issues, and areas that require additional research to address the identified limitations and improve the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
