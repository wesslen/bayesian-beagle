**Summary:**

TestART is a novel unit test generation method that leverages the strengths of large language models (LLMs) while overcoming their limitations. It improves LLM-based unit test generation through the co-evolution of automated generation and repair iteration. TestART uses a template-based repair technique to fix bugs in LLM-generated test cases, employing prompt injection to guide the next-step automated generation and avoid repetition suppression. It also extracts coverage information from passed test cases and utilizes it as testing feedback to enhance the sufficiency of the final test case. This synergy between generation and repair significantly improves the quality, effectiveness, and readability of the produced test cases. In comparative experiments, TestART-generated test cases have a pass rate of 78.55%, which is approximately 18% higher than both the ChatGPT-4.0 model and the same ChatGPT-3.5-based method ChatUniTest. It also achieves an impressive line coverage rate of 90.96% on the focal methods that passed the test, exceeding EvoSuite by 3.4%.
