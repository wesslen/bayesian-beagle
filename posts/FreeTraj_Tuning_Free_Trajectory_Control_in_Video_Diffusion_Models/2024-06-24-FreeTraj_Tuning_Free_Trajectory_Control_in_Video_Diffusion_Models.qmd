### Summary:

The study introduces a tuning-free framework, FreeTraj, for trajectory-controllable video generation using diffusion models. The framework leverages noise guidance and modifications to the attention mechanism to enable trajectory control and extend it to longer and larger video generation. The study reveals several instructive phenomenons about how initial noises influence the generated results of video diffusion models. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach in enhancing the trajectory controllability of video diffusion models.

### Major Findings:

1. The study reveals several instructive phenomenons about how initial noises influence the generated results of video diffusion models.
2. The study introduces a tuning-free framework, FreeTraj, for trajectory-controllable video generation using diffusion models.
3. The framework leverages noise guidance and modifications to the attention mechanism to enable trajectory control and extend it to longer and larger video generation.
4. The study demonstrates that diffusion models inherently possess the capability to control generated content without additional training.
5. The study shows that by guiding noise construction and attention computation, trajectory control can be enabled and extended to longer and larger video generation.

### Analysis and Critique:

The study provides a practical and efficient solution for generating videos with desired motion trajectories. However, the tuning-free paradigm is still limited by the underlying model, such as the consistency of object appearance that easily changes during large movements. The study of initial noises can inspire the development of basic video models. The study could benefit from further research on the limitations and potential biases of the proposed framework. Additionally, the study could explore the potential of the framework for generating videos with more complex motion trajectories.
