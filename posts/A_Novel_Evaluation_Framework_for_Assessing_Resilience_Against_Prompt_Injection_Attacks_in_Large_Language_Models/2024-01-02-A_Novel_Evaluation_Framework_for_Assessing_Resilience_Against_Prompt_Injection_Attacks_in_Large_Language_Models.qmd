### **Summary:**
The article introduces a novel evaluation framework for quantifying the resilience of applications integrated with large language models (LLMs) against prompt injection attacks. The framework incorporates innovative techniques designed to ensure representativeness, interpretability, and robustness. It was applied to two LLMs, ChatGLM and Llama2, with results revealing that Llama2 exhibited higher resilience compared to ChatGLM. The framework offers valuable insights that empower organizations to make well-informed decisions to fortify their applications against potential threats from prompt injection.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The evaluation framework incorporates innovative techniques to ensure representativeness, interpretability, and robustness.
2. A meticulous selection process was employed to ensure the representativeness of simulated attacks on the application, resulting in 115 carefully chosen attacks based on coverage and relevance.
3. Results revealed that Llama2 exhibited higher resilience compared to ChatGLM, aligning with the prevailing notion that newer models tend to possess greater resilience.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
The evaluation framework presented in the article offers a systematic and repeatable way to evaluate the resilience of an application against prompt injection attacks. However, the article does not address the potential limitations or biases of the evaluation framework. Additionally, the study could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of the potential real-world implications of prompt injection attacks on LLM-integrated applications. Further research is needed to address the evolving nature of attack techniques and classifications, as well as to expand the framework to include additional attack techniques and categories. Overall, while the framework offers valuable insights, it is important to consider potential limitations and areas for further research.
