### Summary:

The study explores a methodological experiment to develop a Thurstone scale for assessing attitudes towards individuals living with AIDS. An electronic questionnaire was distributed to a group of judges, including undergraduate, postgraduate, and PhD students from various disciplines, as well as established researchers in social research. The primary innovation of this study is the incorporation of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Model (LLM) to evaluate the initial 63 items, comparing its assessments with those of the human judges. Results showed no significant difference between AI and human judges for 35 items, minor differences for 23 items, and major differences for 5 items. This experiment demonstrates the potential of integrating AI with traditional psychometric methods to enhance the development of attitude measurement scales.

### Major Findings:

1. The study demonstrates that the effort required to construct Thurstone scales has significantly reduced compared to what was the case a century ago, nullifying the simplicity advantage of Likert scales.
2. The incorporation of a Large Language Model (LLM) alongside human judges effectively minimizes the influence and subjectivity associated with the judges' group, making the construction process more efficient and objective.
3. The analysis revealed that in 35 out of the 63 initial items, there is no difference or only a very slight difference between the judges' opinions and the modelâ€™s. Some differences are detected in 23 of the 63 initial items, while 5 items exhibit a major difference in relation to the categorization.

### Analysis and Critique:

The study presents a novel approach to attitude scale development by integrating traditional psychometric techniques with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools. The use of an AI Large Language Model (LLM) to evaluate and categorize attitude items, and comparing these results with those obtained from human judges, is a significant contribution to the field. However, the study could have provided more detailed information on the specific AI model used and its performance metrics. Additionally, the sample size of 75 judges, while diverse, may not be representative of the general population, and the results may not be generalizable. Future research should consider replicating this study with a larger and more diverse sample to validate the findings.
