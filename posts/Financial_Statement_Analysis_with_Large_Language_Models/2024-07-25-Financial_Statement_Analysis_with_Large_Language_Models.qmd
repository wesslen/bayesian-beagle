**Summary:**

This paper investigates the ability of a large language model (LLM), specifically GPT4, to perform financial statement analysis and predict the direction of future earnings. The study compares the performance of GPT4 to that of financial analysts and other benchmarks, such as logistic regression and a state-of-the-art machine learning model. The results show that GPT4 outperforms financial analysts and achieves performance on par with the state-of-the-art machine learning model. The study also finds that GPT4's performance is not due to its memory, but rather its ability to generate useful narrative insights about a company's future performance. Additionally, trading strategies based on GPT's predictions yield higher Sharpe ratios and alphas than strategies based on other models.

**Major Findings:**

1. GPT4 outperforms financial analysts in predicting the direction of future earnings, achieving an accuracy of 60% compared to the analysts' accuracy of 53%.
2. GPT4's performance is on par with the performance of a narrowly trained state-of-the-art machine learning model, with an accuracy of 60.31% compared to the machine learning model's accuracy of 60.45%.
3. GPT4's prediction accuracy is not due to its memory, but rather its ability to generate useful narrative insights about a company's future performance.
4. Trading strategies based on GPT's predictions yield higher Sharpe ratios and alphas than strategies based on other models.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the ability of LLMs to perform financial statement analysis and predict the direction of future earnings. The results are promising, showing that GPT4 can outperform financial analysts and achieve performance on par with state-of-the-art machine learning models. However, the study does not address the potential limitations of LLMs, such as their inability to understand complex financial concepts or their reliance on large amounts of data. Additionally, the study does not address the potential biases or errors that may be introduced by the use of LLMs in financial analysis. Further research is needed to address these limitations and to fully understand the potential of LLMs in financial analysis.
