### Summary:
The academic article introduces LaMAI, a method designed to improve Large Language Models' (LLMs) understanding of user queries by actively inquiring the user for clarification. LaMAI leverages active learning techniques to select and formulate the most informative questions, fostering a dynamic bidirectional dialogue. The method aims to narrow the contextual gap and refine the output of LLMs, aligning it more closely with user expectations. The article also presents the experimental setting for the study, including the datasets used, baseline methods compared, and the evaluation metrics employed. Additionally, it discusses the usage of datasets in experiments and the implementation of active learning in LaMAI, highlighting the challenges and potential enhancements for active learning techniques and presenting a practical algorithm for LaMAI. Furthermore, the article provides information about the hyper-parameters used in the experiments, examples of datasets used, and additional experiment results, including full results on QMSum, an ablation study on active inquiry threshold, performance on user queries with less context, and more algorithm running examples.

### Major Findings:
1. LaMAI effectively improves the comprehension ability of language models regarding user queries.
2. The active inquiry strategy significantly improves performance, especially in situations with less context.
3. LaMAI's practical algorithm streamlines the iterative interaction process, making it more user-friendly while still eliciting the necessary clarifications.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article effectively presents LaMAI as a novel approach to enhancing LLMs' understanding of user queries, addressing the challenges of ambiguous user queries through active learning and uncertainty estimation.
- The experimental setting provides a comprehensive foundation for the study, allowing for the comparison of LaMAI with baseline methods across various datasets, enhancing the credibility and relevance of the study's findings.
- The content in the section about the implementation of active learning in LaMAI is significant as it provides insights into the challenges and potential improvements for active learning techniques and the practical implementation of LaMAI.
- The section providing information about the experimental setup, datasets, and results of the study is crucial for understanding the methodology and outcomes of the study, making it a crucial part of the academic paper.
