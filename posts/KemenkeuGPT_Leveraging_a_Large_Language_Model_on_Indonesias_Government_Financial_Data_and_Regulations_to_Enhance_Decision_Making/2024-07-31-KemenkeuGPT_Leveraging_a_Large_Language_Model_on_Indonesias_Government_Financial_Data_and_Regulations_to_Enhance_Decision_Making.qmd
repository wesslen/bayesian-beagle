### Summary:

- The study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address challenges in analysing and extracting information from Indonesian government financial data and regulations.
- The main objectives of this research are to develop KemenkeuGPT, an LLM application with LangChain and RAG, assess the performance of several pre-trained models on Indonesian financial data and regulations, engage with stakeholders in the Ministry of Finance, improve the performance of KemenkeuGPT, evaluate its performance, and implement a multi-platform interface for KemenkeuGPT application.
- The research process is designed to be cyclic, emphasising continuous improvements through repeated cycles of data collection, processing, development, experiment, evaluation, and refinement.
- KemenkeuGPT has been developed with LangChain framework and iterative development process with RAG, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning.
- The study gathered a comprehensive dataset from multiple reliable sources, including the Ministry of Finance, Statistics Indonesia, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
- The evaluation process involved a comprehensive survey involving officials and experts from the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia, resulting in 100 question and answer (Q&A) entries.
- The study implemented LangChain, a recent open-source software library that offers solutions to streamline the development of custom AI applications using LLMs.
- The development and evaluation process for KemenkeuGPT comprised six phases: improvement through experiments with LLMs, improvement through stakeholder feedback, improvement through additional data for RAG, improvement through prompt engineering, improvement through fine-tuning, and continuous improvement through human feedback.
- The study employed a human evaluation method, engaging collaborators from various departments within the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia, to assess the accuracy of the LLMâ€™s outputs.
- The study also implemented an LLM-based evaluation using LangChain string evaluator and a comparative analysis between KemenkeuGPT and other LLMs utilising the RAGAS framework.

### Major Findings:

1. KemenkeuGPT, an LLM application with LangChain and RAG, has been developed to address challenges in analysing and extracting information from Indonesian government financial data and regulations.
2. The study gathered a comprehensive dataset from multiple
