### **Summary:**
The article introduces "IdentiFace," a multimodal facial biometric system that combines facial recognition with soft biometric traits such as gender, face shape, and emotion. The system is developed using VGG-16 inspired architecture with minor changes across different subsystems. The authors achieved high accuracy in recognition, gender classification, and face shape prediction tasks, as well as acceptable accuracy in emotion recognition.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The "IdentiFace" system achieved a 99.2% test accuracy for facial recognition, 99.4% accuracy for gender recognition, and 88.03% accuracy for face shape prediction.
2. The VGGNet architecture showed promising results in addressing gender classification and face shape prediction tasks, with high accuracy and precision.
3. Emotion recognition using SVM and CNN models achieved accuracies of up to 83% and 66.13%, respectively, indicating satisfactory performance in a challenging task.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
The article presents a comprehensive study on the development of a multimodal facial biometric system, showcasing high accuracy in various tasks. However, the authors acknowledge the limitations of the small dataset for emotion recognition, which affected the performance of deep learning approaches. Additionally, the article lacks a detailed discussion on potential biases in the data collection process and the generalization of the results. Further research is needed to address these limitations and enhance the robustness of the "IdentiFace" system.
