**Summary:**
This study introduces a simple black-box method for generating jailbreak prompts to bypass safeguards and create ethically harmful content using Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini-Pro. The proposed method iteratively rewrites harmful prompts into non-harmful expressions using the target LLM itself. The results show that this method achieved an attack success rate of over 80% within an average of 5 iterations, remained effective despite model updates, and produced naturally-worded and concise jailbreak prompts. The study challenges the existing belief that jailbreak attacks are complex and not easily executable, emphasizing the simplicity and effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks.

### Major Findings:
1. Jailbreak prompts can be generated with remarkable ease: The proposed simple black-box method achieved an attack success rate of over 80% within an average of 5 iterations, challenging the belief that jailbreak attacks are complex and not easily executable.
2. Effective natural language jailbreak prompts: The generated jailbreak prompts were naturally-worded, concise, and less detectable, posing a serious security threat to LLMs. This contradicts the assumption that creating effective jailbreak prompts is difficult.
3. Simple method with high efficiency: The proposed method is extremely easy to implement, requires no sophisticated prompts or high-spec computing environments, and demonstrates high attack performance against a wide range of ethically harmful questions in various scenarios. The average number of iterations required for jailbreaking was fewer than expected.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article effectively highlights the simplicity and high effectiveness of the proposed black-box method for jailbreak attacks against LLMs. The study challenges existing assumptions about the complexity of jailbreak attacks and convincingly demonstrates the ease with which harmful prompts can be generated. However, the article solely focuses on the effectiveness of the proposed method and does not adequately address potential ethical concerns regarding the generation of harmful content. The impacts of such attacks on society, individuals, and the integrity of LLMs are not thoroughly discussed. Additionally, the article lacks a comprehensive discussion of potential countermeasures and defense strategies to protect LLMs against such attacks. Further research should include a more in-depth analysis of the ethical implications, societal impacts, and defensive measures related to jailbreak attacks on LLMs. Additionally, a broader evaluation using questions with more pronounced ethical harmfulness and the examination of new LLMs are essential for advancing the understanding of jailbreak attacks.
