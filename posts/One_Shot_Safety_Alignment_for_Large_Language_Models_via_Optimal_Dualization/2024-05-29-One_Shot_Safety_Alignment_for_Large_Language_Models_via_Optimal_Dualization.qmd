### Summary:

The paper presents a dualization perspective for constrained alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences, aiming to improve their helpfulness and safety. The proposed method reduces the constrained alignment problem to an equivalent unconstrained alignment, enabling a one-shot training strategy without cumbersome primal-dual iterations. The paper introduces two practical algorithms, MoCAN and PeCAN, for model-based and preference-based scenarios, respectively, using pseudo-preference optimization. The effectiveness of the methods is demonstrated through experiments, which show that the proposed approach can benefit researchers in building safer language models.

### Major Findings:

1. The paper presents a dualization perspective for constrained alignment of LMs, which reduces the problem to an equivalent unconstrained alignment, enabling a one-shot training strategy without cumbersome primal-dual iterations.
2. Two practical algorithms, MoCAN and PeCAN, are introduced for model-based and preference-based scenarios, respectively, using pseudo-preference optimization.
3. The proposed approach is shown to be effective in improving the helpfulness and safety of LMs through experiments.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents an innovative approach to aligning LMs with human preferences, addressing the challenges of training instability and increased sensitivity to hyperparameters in existing methods. The proposed dualization perspective and the two practical algorithms, MoCAN and PeCAN, offer a promising direction for improving the helpfulness and safety of LMs. However, the paper only studies the Bradley-Terry preference setup and is limited to a single safety constraint due to the lack of suitable datasets. Future work should explore more general preference setups and experiments with multiple safety constraints. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations or ethical implications of the proposed approach, which should be considered in future research.
