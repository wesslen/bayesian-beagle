### **Summary:**
- The article introduces Toisón de Oro, a bilingual framework for financial natural language processing (NLP) in Spanish and English.
- Toisón de Oro includes instruction datasets, finetuned large language models (LLMs), and an evaluation benchmark for financial LLMs in Spanish and English.
- The framework aims to bridge the gap in Spanish financial NLP and application studies compared to English.

### **Major Findings:**
1. **Significance of Spanish in Finance:**
   - Spanish is the fourth most spoken language globally, with 485 million native speakers and 15 million secondary speakers in the U.S.
   - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in finance has accelerated advancements, but there is a notable language disparity in the development of financial LLMs for Spanish.

2. **Development of Toisón de Oro:**
   - Toisón de Oro includes the first open-source multi-task and Spanish-English bilingual instructional data (FIT-ES) with 151k samples from 15 datasets covering 7 tasks.
   - The framework also introduces the first open-source Spanish-English bilingual evaluation benchmark (FLARE-ES) with 21 datasets covering 9 tasks and the first open-source Spanish-English bilingual financial LLM, FinMA-ES.

3. **Performance of FinMA-ES:**
   - FinMA-ES models surpass state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 in Spanish financial tasks, highlighting the positive impact of cross-linguistic transfer.
   - The FLARE-ES benchmark evaluation indicates that FinMA-ES models notably outperform leading LLMs in Spanish financial tasks due to strategic instruction tuning and data from both low- and high-resource languages.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The article addresses the linguistic disparity in the financial domain and introduces a novel bilingual framework. However, the study has limitations, including parameter restrictions, limited evaluation benchmark diversity, and potential ethical and practical concerns. Further research is needed to address these limitations and refine the models and evaluation methods.
