### Summary:

Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in recent years, impacting various aspects of people's lives, including education. Concerns have arisen regarding the ethical implications of LLMs, particularly in higher education computer science. To address these concerns, the authors conducted a case study involving interviews with 20 stakeholders in higher education computer science. The study revealed that students have distinct mental models for interacting with LLMs, using them as writing tools, coding tools, and information retrieval tools, each with varying ethical considerations. Ethical issues raised by the participants included inaccurate LLM responses, hallucinations, biases, privacy leakage, and academic integrity concerns. Stakeholders emphasized the need for guidance and rules for LLM use in higher education, including teaching digital literacy, rethinking education, and implementing cautious and contextual policies. The research findings contribute to understanding the ethical challenges of LLMs in higher education and propose solutions for policy and governance.

### Major Findings:
1. Students use LLMs as writing tools, coding tools, and information retrieval tools, each with distinct ethical considerations.
2. Ethical concerns raised by stakeholders include inaccurate LLM responses, hallucinations, biases, privacy leakage, and academic integrity issues.
3. Stakeholders emphasized the necessity of guidance and rules for LLM use in higher education, including teaching digital literacy, rethinking education, and implementing cautious and contextual policies.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the ethical considerations of LLMs in higher education. However, it predominantly focuses on the perspectives of stakeholders and does not delve into potential quantitative data to support the qualitative findings. Additionally, while the study identifies a range of ethical issues, it lacks a comprehensive exploration of possible solutions and their implications. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of proposed solutions and to address the existing gaps in understanding the ethical implications of LLMs in computer science education. Moreover, the article could benefit from more in-depth discussions on the potential impact of LLMs on student learning outcomes and the effectiveness of academic assessment in the context of LLM usage.
