# Summary:

The paper introduces a novel jailbreaking detector called Cross-modality Information DEtectoR (CIDER) designed to identify maliciously perturbed image inputs in Vision Language Models (VLMs). CIDER is a plug-and-play solution that is independent of the target VLMs and requires less computation cost. The detector utilizes the cross-modal similarity between harmful queries and adversarial images to enhance the security of VLMs against jailbreak attacks.

## Major Findings:

1. CIDER is a simple yet effective cross-modality information detector that is independent of the target VLMs and requires less computation cost.
2. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CIDER, as well as its transferability to both white-box and black-box VLMs.
3. CIDER is a plug-and-play jailbreaking detector that can effectively safeguard VLMs while incurring almost no additional computational overhead.

## Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a promising approach to enhancing the security of VLMs against jailbreak attacks. However, the following limitations and potential areas for improvement should be considered:

1. The effectiveness of CIDER heavily relies on the quality of the cross-modal embeddings used to represent the image and text inputs. The performance of CIDER may be affected by the choice of the embedding method and the quality of the pre-trained models used to generate the embeddings.
2. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the robustness of CIDER against different types of adversarial attacks. It would be interesting to evaluate the performance of CIDER against a wider range of adversarial attacks, including those that target the image and text modalities separately.
3. The paper does not discuss the potential impact of CIDER on the performance of VLMs in downstream tasks. It would be important to evaluate the trade-off between the security benefits of using CIDER and the potential impact on the performance of VLMs in real-world applications.

Overall, the paper presents a promising approach to enhancing the security of VLMs against jailbreak attacks. However, further research is needed to address the limitations and potential areas for improvement identified in this analysis.
