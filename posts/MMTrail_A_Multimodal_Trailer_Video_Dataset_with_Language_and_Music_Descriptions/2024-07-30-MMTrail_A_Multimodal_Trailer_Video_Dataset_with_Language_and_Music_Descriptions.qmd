# Summary:

**MMtrail: A Multimodal Trailer Video Dataset with Language and Music Descriptions**

**Summary:**

* The paper introduces MMTrail, a large-scale multimodal video-language dataset that includes over 20M trailer clips with visual captions and 2M high-quality clips with multimodal captions.
* Trailers are used as a source of data due to their diverse topics, various content characters, and custom-designed background music, which makes them more coherent with the visual context.
* The authors propose a systemic captioning framework to achieve various modality annotations with more than 27.1k hours of trailer videos, ensuring that the caption retains music perspective while preserving the authority of visual context.
* The MMtrail dataset is expected to pave the path for fine-grained large multimodal-language model training and has demonstrated high-quality annotation and effectiveness for model training in experiments.

**Major Findings:**

1. MMTrail is a large-scale multimodal video-language dataset that includes over 20M trailer clips with visual captions and 2M high-quality clips with multimodal captions.
2. The dataset is designed to address the gap in current video-language datasets that primarily provide text descriptions for visual frames and overlook the potential of inherent audio-visual correlation.
3. The authors propose a systemic captioning framework to achieve various modality annotations with more than 27.1k hours of trailer videos, ensuring that the caption retains music perspective while preserving the authority of visual context.

**Analysis and Critique:**

* The paper presents a promising approach to addressing the gap in current video-language datasets by introducing a large-scale multimodal video-language dataset that includes over 20M trailer clips with visual captions and 2M high-quality clips with multimodal captions.
* The use of trailers as a source of data is a novel approach that takes advantage of their diverse topics, various content characters, and custom-designed background music, which makes them more coherent with the visual context.
* The proposed systemic caption
