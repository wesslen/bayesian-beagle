**Summary:**

**Major Takeaways:**
- The paper presents methodologically stringent case studies applied to well-known open source Python libraries pillow and numpy, using the LLM ChatGPT-4, to optimize source code for **energy and compute efficiency** in **interactive** collaboration with a human expert.
- LLM ChatGPT-4 was successful in optimizing the source code, with improvements reported for the same expert across multiple case studies, where performance improvements ranged from 1.2 to 38 times.
- The case studies demonstrate a strong potential for **practical utility** of LLMs in collaborative code optimization for open-source Python libraries.
