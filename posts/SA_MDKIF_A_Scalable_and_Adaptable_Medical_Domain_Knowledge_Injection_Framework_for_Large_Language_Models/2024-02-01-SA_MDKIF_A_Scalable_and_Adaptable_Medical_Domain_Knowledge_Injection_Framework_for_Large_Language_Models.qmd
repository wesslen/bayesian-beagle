### Summary:
- The SA-MDKIF framework is designed to inject medical knowledge into general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to improve their performance in medical natural language processing tasks.
- SA-MDKIF consists of two stages: skill training and skill adaptation, with experimental results showing significant performance improvements.
- The parameterization of the incremental matrix update and the training of skills in parallel are crucial components of the proposed knowledge injection framework.
- Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the SA-MDKIF method in normal and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness and rationality.
- The AdaLoRA method provides a systematic approach to manage the budget of fine-tunable parameters, offering a practical solution to optimize the training process.

### Major Findings:
1. SA-MDKIF improves LLM performance by 10-20% compared to the original models, with an improvement of up to 30% for unseen medical tasks.
2. The SA-MDKIF method demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to other fine-tuning methods, especially in few-shot settings.
3. The AdaLoRA method offers a practical solution to optimize the training process and improve the performance of language models in various applications.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The SA-MDKIF framework addresses the lack of medical domain knowledge in general-purpose LLMs, but potential limitations or biases in the experimental design should be considered.
- The parameterization approach and the skill adaptation process are essential for enhancing the performance of the model, but further research is needed to explore the scalability and generalizability of the framework.
- The empirical evidence of the superior performance and efficiency of the SA-MDKIF method in both normal and few-shot settings is compelling, but additional studies should investigate its applicability to diverse medical tasks and datasets.
- The AdaLoRA method provides a practical solution to optimize the training process, but its robustness and adaptability to different types of language models warrant further investigation.
