# Summary

The paper proposes a novel method to train a video VAE, named CV-VAE, for latent generative video models that is compatible with existing image and video models, such as Stable Diffusion and SVD. The proposed method aims to provide a truly spatio-temporally compressed continuous space for training latent generative video models, which is compatible with existing image and video models, greatly reducing the expense of training or finetuning video models. The paper also proposes a latent space regularization to avoid distribution shifts and designs an efficient architecture for the video VAE.

## Major Findings

1. The proposed CV-VAE provides a truly spatio-temporally compressed continuous space for training latent generative video models, which is compatible with existing image and video models, greatly reducing the expense of training or finetuning video models.
2. The proposed latent space regularization avoids distribution shifts and improves the training efficiency of the video VAE.
3. The proposed efficient architecture for the video VAE reduces the computational complexity and improves the reconstruction performance.

## Analysis and Critique

The paper proposes a novel method to train a video VAE that is compatible with existing image and video models, which is a significant contribution to the field of latent generative video models. The proposed method provides a truly spatio-temporally compressed continuous space for training latent generative video models, which is compatible with existing image and video models, greatly reducing the expense of training or finetuning video models. The proposed latent space regularization and efficient architecture for the video VAE are also significant contributions to the field.

However, the paper does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method on different datasets and tasks. The paper only evaluates the proposed method on the COCO2017 validation dataset and the Webvid validation dataset, which may not be representative of other datasets and tasks. The paper also does not compare the proposed method with other state-of-the-art methods for latent generative video models.

In addition, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations and challenges of the proposed method. For example, the proposed method may not be able to handle complex and dynamic scenes with large motion and occlusion. The proposed method may also suffer from the problem of overfitting, especially
