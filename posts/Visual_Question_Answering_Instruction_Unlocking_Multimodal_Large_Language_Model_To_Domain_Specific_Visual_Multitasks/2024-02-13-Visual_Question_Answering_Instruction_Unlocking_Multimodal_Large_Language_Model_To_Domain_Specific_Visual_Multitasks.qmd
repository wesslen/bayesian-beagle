### **Summary:**
- Large language models (LLMs) have been successful in natural language processing (NLP) applications and are now being extended to multimodal inputs.
- Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have primarily been used for vision-language tasks, but not for domain-specific visual tasks.
- The Visual Question Answering Instruction (VQA-IN) method was developed to transform domain-specific visual and vision-language datasets into a unified question answering format, extending MLLM to domain-specific tasks.

### Major Findings:
1. VQA-IN transforms vision-language datasets and domain-specific visual datasets into a unified question answering format.
2. The study introduces a visual instruction approach for integrating domain-specific vision tasks into MLLMs.
3. Smaller versions of LLMs (sLLMs) achieved efficient performance in vision-language as well as domain-specific visual tasks within a multitask manner.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study successfully extended the capabilities of MLLMs to domain-specific visual tasks, but the evaluation was limited to a few specific datasets.
- The method's effectiveness was demonstrated across multiple architectures, but the generalizability to other datasets and tasks needs further exploration.
- The study's focus on multitasking and performance maintenance is valuable, but potential biases in the dataset selection and model training should be considered.
