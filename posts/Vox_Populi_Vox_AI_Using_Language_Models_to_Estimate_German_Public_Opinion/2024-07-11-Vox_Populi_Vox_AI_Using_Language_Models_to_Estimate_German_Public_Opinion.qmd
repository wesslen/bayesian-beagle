**Summary:**

This academic paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5, to estimate public opinion and predict voting behavior in Germany. The study compares the LLM's predicted vote choices with the actual vote choices reported by respondents in the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES). The findings reveal that GPT-3.5 overestimated the vote shares for the Greens, the Left, and non-voters, while underestimating the vote shares for FDP and AfD when compared to GLES. The LLM's overall predictive accuracy was modest, with a matching prediction rate of 0.46. GPT-3.5's predictions were more accurate for voters of the Greens, CDU/CSU, and the Left, but displayed poor predictive power for FDP and AfD voters. The study also highlights the limitations of using LL
