### **Summary:**
The article introduces ConstraintChecker, a plugin for Large Language Models (LLMs) aimed at addressing the challenge of explicit relational constraints in the reasoning of Commonsense Knowledge Bases (CSKB). The main issue addressed is the inability of LLMs to acquire explicit relational constraints from in-context exemplars, leading to incorrect predictions in CSKB reasoning tasks. ConstraintChecker employs a rule-based module to derive constraints and a zero-shot learning module to check the satisfaction of these constraints, thereby correcting false positive predictions. The experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements over all prompting methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance on two CSKB Reasoning benchmarks, CKBPv2 and SD-ATOMIC. The contributions of the article are the proposal of ConstraintChecker and the comprehensive experiments demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Major Findings:
1. Reasoning over Commonsense Knowledge Bases (CSKB) (e.g., determining if a new knowledge triple is commonsense based on the reference knowledge) is a valuable way to expand knowledge bases and enhance AI models in various applications.
2. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with acquiring explicit relational constraints in CSKBs, leading to incorrect predictions, which prompts the need for a solution like ConstraintChecker.
3. ConstraintChecker significantly improves over all prompting methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CSKB Reasoning benchmarks, CKBPv2, and SD-ATOMIC.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article effectively addresses an important issue in the field of Natural Language Processing by proposing a plugin, ConstraintChecker, to enhance the performance of Large Language Models in reasoning over Commonsense Knowledge Bases. The experimental results support the effectiveness of ConstraintChecker, demonstrating its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in CSKB Reasoning tasks.

One potential limitation is the complexity of the rule-based module, as it requires a deep understanding of the task and benchmarks. Additionally, the study primarily focuses on CSKB reasoning and evaluates the proposed method on two specific benchmarks, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other reasoning tasks. Therefore, future research should explore the applicability of ConstraintChecker to other reasoning tasks and expand the experimental evaluation to provide a more comprehensive analysis. Moreover, while the article effectively addresses the impact of ConstraintChecker on False Positive predictions, it does not extend the analysis to cover interventions on False Negatives, presenting a potential area for future research. Lastly, given the ethical considerations and computational costs associated with Large Language Models, the article could further discuss potential implications and resource requirements for implementing ConstraintChecker in practical applications.
