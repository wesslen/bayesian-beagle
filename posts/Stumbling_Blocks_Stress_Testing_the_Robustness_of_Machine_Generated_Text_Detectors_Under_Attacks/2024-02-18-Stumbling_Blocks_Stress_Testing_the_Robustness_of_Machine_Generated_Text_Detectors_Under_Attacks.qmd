### Summary:
- The study evaluates the robustness of machine-generated text (MGT) detectors under various attacks, revealing vulnerabilities and proposing defense patches.
- It discusses the impact of attacks on different types of detectors and the need for more robust detection methods.
- The experiment settings for evaluating the performance of different language models in generating human-written text (HWT) and MGT are detailed, including dataset, sampling methods, temperature settings, and detector hyperparameters.

### Major Findings:
1. Almost none of the existing detectors remain robust under all attacks, with an average performance drop of 35% across all attacks.
2. The comparison of detector performance under various attack scenarios and the proposed defense patches offer valuable information for researchers and practitioners in the field of natural language processing and machine learning.
3. The specific dataset, sampling methods, temperature settings, and detector hyperparameters are crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the experimental results.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study's findings have implications for the development of more robust detection methodologies to address the identified vulnerabilities.
- The comparison of detector performance under various attack scenarios and the proposed defense patches offer valuable information for researchers and practitioners in the field of natural language processing and machine learning.
- The specific dataset, sampling methods, temperature settings, and detector hyperparameters are crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the experimental results.
