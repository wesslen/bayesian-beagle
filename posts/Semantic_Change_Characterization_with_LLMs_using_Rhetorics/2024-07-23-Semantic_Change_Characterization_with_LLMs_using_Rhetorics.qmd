### Summary:

The paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in characterizing semantic changes in language, specifically focusing on dimension, relation, and orientation changes. The authors propose a method that combines LLMs' Chain-of-Thought with rhetorical devices and conducts an experimental assessment using newly created datasets. The results highlight the effectiveness of LLMs in capturing and analyzing semantic changes, providing valuable insights to improve computational linguistic applications.

### Major Findings:

1. LLMs can effectively capture and analyze semantic changes in language, including dimension, relation, and orientation changes.
2. The proposed method, which combines LLMs' Chain-of-Thought with rhetorical devices, improves the accuracy of LLMs in characterizing semantic changes.
3. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs in recognizing figurative usage and differentiating orientation.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper provides a novel approach to characterizing semantic changes using LLMs, which has the potential to improve computational linguistic applications.
2. The experimental results are promising, but the method's effectiveness may vary depending on the quality and size of the training data.
3. The paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed method, such as the potential for LLMs to generate incorrect reasoning or hallucinate explanations.
4. The paper does not provide a comparison with other methods for characterizing semantic changes, which could help to better evaluate the proposed method's performance.
5. The paper does not discuss the potential for the proposed method to be used in real-world applications, such as improving the performance of chatbots or automatic translation systems.

Overall, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of computational linguistics by proposing a novel approach to characterizing semantic changes using LLMs. However, further research is needed to evaluate the proposed method's limitations and potential for real-world applications.
