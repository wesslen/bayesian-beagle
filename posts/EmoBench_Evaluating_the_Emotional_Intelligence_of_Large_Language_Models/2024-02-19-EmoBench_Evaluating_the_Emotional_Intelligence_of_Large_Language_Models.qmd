### Summary:
- The article introduces the need for a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the Emotional Intelligence (EI) of Large Language Models (LLMs).
- EMOBENCH is proposed as a benchmark that draws upon established psychological theories and includes a set of 400 hand-crafted questions in English and Chinese to assess Emotional Understanding and Emotional Application.
- The results reveal a considerable gap between the EI of existing LLMs and the average human, highlighting a promising direction for future research.

### Major Findings:
1. EMOBENCH addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks and provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' emotional intelligence.
2. There is a significant gap between existing LLMs and human performance in understanding and applying emotions.
3. The introduction of EMOBENCH has the potential to advance the evaluation of LLMs' emotional intelligence and contribute to the development of more emotionally intelligent systems.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The proposed benchmark, EMOBENCH, addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks and provides a more thorough evaluation of LLMs' EI capabilities.
- The findings reveal a significant gap between existing LLMs and human performance, indicating the need for further research in this area.
- The limitations of the benchmark, such as language and modality constraints, are acknowledged, indicating potential areas for future improvement.
