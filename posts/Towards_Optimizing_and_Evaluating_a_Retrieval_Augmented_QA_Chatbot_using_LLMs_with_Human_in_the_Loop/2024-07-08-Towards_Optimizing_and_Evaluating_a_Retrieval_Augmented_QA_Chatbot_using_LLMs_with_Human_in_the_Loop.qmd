### Summary:

The paper presents a study on the development of an HR support chatbot using Large Language Models (LLMs) with a human-in-the-loop approach. The chatbot was developed in collaboration with SAP SE to address employee inquiries efficiently and effectively. The study focuses on enhancing the chatbot's response quality and exploring alternative retrieval methods. The experiments and evaluation conclude that GPT-4 outperforms other models and can overcome inconsistencies in data through internal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, reference-free evaluation metrics such as G-Eval and Prometheus demonstrate reliability closely aligned with human evaluation.

### Major Findings:

1. The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach was used to develop the HR chatbot, allowing the model to produce more grounded answers and reducing hallucinations.
2. The study optimized different modules of the standard RAG pipeline, such as the retriever and model prompts, while constantly incorporating feedback from domain experts.
3. The experiments benchmarked OpenAI's models and used the open-source LongT5 and BERT as baselines. The findings related to the retriever and the reliability of automatic evaluation metrics can benefit both the industry and the research community.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper does not provide a detailed description of the methodology used for prompt optimization and evaluation, which could be essential for reproducibility and further research.
2. The study does not discuss the limitations of using LLMs for HR support, such as potential biases in the generated responses or the need for continuous updates to keep up with changing HR policies.
3. The paper does not address the potential privacy concerns related to using LLMs for HR support, as these models may require access to sensitive employee data.
4. The study does not explore the potential of using other LLMs or hybrid models that combine the strengths of different models to improve the chatbot's performance further.
5. The paper does not discuss the scalability and generalizability of the proposed approach to other domains or industries, which could be an essential aspect of its practical applicability.
