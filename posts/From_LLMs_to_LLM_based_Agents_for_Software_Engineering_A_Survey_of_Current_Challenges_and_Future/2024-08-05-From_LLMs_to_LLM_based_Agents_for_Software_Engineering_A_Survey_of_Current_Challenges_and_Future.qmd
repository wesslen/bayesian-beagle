**Summary:**

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current practice and solutions for Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents in software engineering. LLMs, such as GPT and Codex, have shown remarkable capabilities in handling downstream tasks in SE, including code generation, debugging, and documentation. However, they also exhibit limitations, such as limited context length and hallucinations. To address these challenges, LLM-based agents have emerged, combining LLMs with external tools and resources to enable more dynamic and autonomous operations. These agents can perform a wide range of tasks, such as autonomous debugging, code refactoring, and adaptive test generation, demonstrating capabilities that approach artificial general intelligence (AGI).

The paper covers six key topics: requirement engineering, code generation, autonomous decision-making, software design and evaluation, software test generation, and software security and maintenance. LLMs and LLM-based agents
