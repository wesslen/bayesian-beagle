The study suggests that simulating human opinion dynamics is within the capabilities of LLMs and that they have the potential to play an important role in collective processes of opinion formation in online social media.\n\n\n### Introduction to Large Language Models:\n\n- LLMs possess sophisticated domain over language semantics, enabling them to function as social agents capable of complex interactions with humans and other artificial agents.\n- They have raised concerns about the potential spread of misinformation and harmful content in online discourse.\n\n### Methods:\n\n- The study designed a synthetic persuasion dialogue scenario on climate change, where a 'convincer' LLM agent generated persuasive arguments for a 'skeptic' LLM agent, with human judges evaluating the persuasiveness of machine-generated arguments.\n- Conversation setup involved a dyadic interaction between the 'convincer' and the 'skeptic', with varying levels of skepticism and persuasive language incorporated.\n- Evaluations were conducted to quantify persuasiveness and rank the dimensions of persuasive language based on human judgments and LLM interactions.\n\n### Results:\n\n- The study observed an inverse association between the skeptic's stubbornness and the probability of persuasion, with certain dimensions such as trust and support being most effective in altering the skeptic's viewpoint.\n- Human evaluations generally aligned with LLM preferences for social dimensions in persuasive arguments, with some notable differences such as a stronger preference for knowledge-based arguments among humans and differences in dimensions' persuasive strengths.\n\n### Discussion:\n\n- The study highlighted limitations in the experimental design and offered future research directions including diversifying agent profiles, enhancing ecological validity, and further exploration of effective system prompts and human judgment methodologies.\n- Ethical considerations were raised regarding the potential risks of deploying LLMs for persuasive purposes on social media and the need for research on understanding and combating malicious uses of generative AI.\n\n### Critique:\n\nThe study provides valuable insights into the persuasive capabilities of LLMs, but it is limited in its ecological validity and may not fully capture the complexities of real-world social interactions. Additionally, while the study discusses potential ethical concerns, it could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of the ethical implications of deploying LLMs for persuasive purposes and the potential societal impacts.

The study uses a range of LLMs and tasks to demonstrate how LLMs may be exposed to task examples during pre-training, leading to inflated performance in zero-shot and few-shot settings. The authors employ various methods, such as training data inspection, task example extraction, and chronological analysis, to provide evidence of task contamination. The results indicate that closed-sourced models may demonstrate inflated performance in zero-shot or few-shot evaluation, and are therefore not trustworthy baselines in these settings. Additionally, the paper uncovers challenges in assessing task contamination due to different formats of training data and the difficulty in extracting task examples. The findings suggest a need for caution in relying on LLMs for zero-shot and few-shot tasks and call for additional research to understand the extent of task contamination for large language models.\n\n### Major Takeaways\n\n1. Closed-sourced models may demonstrate inflated performance in zero-shot or few-shot evaluation, casting doubt on their trustworthiness as baselines in these settings.\n2. LLMs rarely show statistically significant improvements over majority baselines in both zero and few-shot settings for tasks without demonstrated possibility of task contamination.\n3.

The paper presents a comprehensive comparison of different hallucination detection methods at both the passage and word levels, demonstrating the effectiveness of the RAGTruth dataset in fine-tuning LLMs for competitive performance in hallucination detection.\n3. The study shows the potential of developing better hallucination detection methods using RAGTruth, as it can significantly reduce the occurrence of hallucinations in the responses from LLMs, even for models with inherently low hallucination rates.\n\n### Introduction\n- **Hallucination Challenges in LLMs**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating content that is not based on factual or accurate information, leading to hallucinations. Various methods have been developed to mitigate hallucinations, but reliable detection remains a challenge.\n- **Need for Benchmark Datasets**: The lack of high-quality, large-scale datasets specifically designed for hallucination detection, particularly in RAG settings, is a key challenge.\n\n### Construction Process of RAGTruth\n- **Response Generation**: Responses were generated using six models for Summarization, Question Answering, and Data-to-Text tasks.\n- **Human Annotation**: Annotators manually annotated specific spans of text containing hallucinated information and categorized them into four types. Additional annotations were provided for adaptive evaluation.\n- **Annotations for Adaptive Evaluation**: Two additional annotations, \"Incorrectly Refusing to Answer\" and \"Differences in Handling Null Value,\" were provided to accurately reflect contentious situations.\n\n### Hallucination Benchmark Analysis\n- **Basic Statistics**: RAGTruth is considerably large in scale, contains longer prompt and response lengths, and features a higher frequency of baseless info hallucinations.\n- **Hallucination Statistics**: The data-to-text task exhibited the highest frequency of hallucinations, especially influenced by stereotypes inherent in the business data.\n- **Hallucination vs Models**: OpenAI\u2019s models demonstrated notably lower hallucination rates compared to others, and a negative correlation was observed between the model scale and the hallucination density.\n- **Hallucination Suppression**: Strategies utilizing the hallucination detector significantly reduced the hallucination rate across different LLMs and tasks.\n\n### Experimental Results\n- **Response-level Detection**: Fine-tuning Llama-2-13B using the RAGTruth dataset achieved the best performance in response-level detection, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in improving the model\u2019s detection ability for hallucinations.\n- **Span-level Detection**: Span-level detection remained challenging, with the fine-tuned model showing improved capability, though still falling short of perfect detection.\n- **Hallucination Suppression**: Strategies employing the fine-tuned hallucination detector significantly reduced the rate of hallucinations across different LLMs and tasks.\n\n### Critique\n- The study demonstrates advancements in the detection and suppression of hallucinations in LLMs, but more comprehensive evaluation metrics and real-world applicability of the findings could add strength to the conclusions. Additionally, the dataset's generalizability to different types of hallucinations and the potential bias in the annotators' judgment could be potential areas of concern.", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00396v1", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2401.00396v1", "abs": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00396v1"}, "authors": ["Yuanhao Wu", "Juno Zhu", "Siliang Xu", "Kashun Shum", "Cheng Niu", "Randy Zhong", "Juntong Song", "Tong Zhang"], "title": "RAGTruth: A Hallucination Corpus for Developing Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Language Models", "subtitle": "RAGTruth is a dataset for analyzing hallucinations in large language models, helping measure and prevent unsupported claims in retrieved content.", "categories": ["dataset", "prompt-engineering"], "publish_date": "2023-12-31", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "image": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2401.00396v1/x1.png", "word_count": 6757, "is_truncated": false}}

The interaction unfolded in five stages with fixed and generated text for different stages.\n\n- **Persuasive Language of the Convincer**: The Convincer was instructed to generate arguments incorporating different dimensions of social pragmatics, and their effectiveness was assessed.\n\n- **Stubbornness of the Skeptic**: The study tested various levels of the Skeptic's stubbornness and evaluated their impact on persuasion.\n\n- **Evaluation**: The persuasiveness of LLM-generated arguments was quantified and compared with evaluations by human judges through crowdsourced annotations.\n\n### Results\n- **Persuading AI Agents**: The probability of persuasion was found to decrease with the Skeptic\u2019s stubbornness. The dimensions of trust, support, and status were most effective in altering the Skeptic\u2019s viewpoint.\n\n- **Persuading Humans**: Human evaluations revealed parallels with LLM agent dynamics, with trust, support, knowledge, and status being ranked higher. However, humans exhibited a stronger preference for knowledge-based arguments compared to LLM agents.\n\n### Discussion\nThe discussion section highlighted the study's limitations and proposed avenues for future research, including multi-turn conversations among multiple agents and diverse profiles for individual agents.\n\n### Critique\nThe study showcases the potential of LLMs in persuasive language generation but has limitations in replicating complex human dynamics and understanding the mechanisms that induce LLM agents to signal a change of opinion. Additionally, the oversimplification, lack of diverse profiles for agents, and a focus on single-turn interactions limit the generalizability of the findings to real-world social media interactions. The study also acknowledges the ethical implications of deploying AI agents for persuasion and the potential risks associated with their use, suggesting the need for research to understand and mitigate those risks.

The company's existing recommender, RevRecV1, was found to be inaccurate and slow due to its reliance on file authorship frequency for reviewer assignment. The authors developed RevRecV2, which uses author-reviewer familiarity, reviewer workload, and the bystander effect factors to improve accuracy and latency. They found significant improvements in accuracy (14 percentage points) and reduction in latency (14 times) with RevRecV2. RevRecWL, designed to balance reviewer workload, showed a reduction in workload when a reasonable candidate with lower workload was available. However, there were no statistically significant changes in review cycle time or latency. The BystanderRecRnd, designed to reduce the bystander effect, reduced time-in-review by 11.6% with no regressions in guardrail metrics.\n\n### Major Takeaways\n1. **Improvements in Accuracy and Latency with RevRecV2**: RevRecV2 led to a 14 percentage point improvement in accuracy and a 14 times reduction in latency at the 90th percentile, with recommendations being selected by authors 27% more often.\n2. **Balancing Reviewer Workload with RevRecWL**: RevRecWL showed a reduction in workload when a reasonable candidate with lower workload was available, but no statistically significant changes in review cycle time or latency were observed.\n3. **Reducing the Bystander Effect with BystanderRecRnd**: BystanderRecRnd reduced time-in-review by 11.6% without any regressions in guardrail metrics.\n\n### Critique\nOne potential problem with the paper is the dependency on historical data for simulating reviewer performance, which may not fully represent real-world conditions.

However, existing methods may impact the accuracy of the models, especially when embedding watermarks.\n\n#### Related Work\n- Backdoor attacks, particularly training-based and training-free backdoor methods, are prevalent in the context of model security.\n- Model watermarking can be categorized into black-box and no-box watermarking, where the verifier\u2019s knowledge and control of the model differ.\n- Backdoor techniques are commonly used for black-box model watermarking, but they can impact the functionality of the original model.\n\n#### A Performance-lossless Branch Watermarking Protocol for Model\n- The paper details a branch watermarking protocol that aims to protect model intellectual property without affecting the original model's functionality. It describes the threat model, proposed model watermarking protocol, and analyzes potential attacks.\n- The protocol includes two main modules: the model and the watermark, with several sub-modules. It introduces a formal security analysis that demonstrates the lossless performance of the model watermarking protocol.\n\n#### Performance-lossless and Secure Watermarking for Language Model\n- A concrete example of the branch backdoor-based watermarking protocol for a language model is provided, demonstrating the protocol's implementation in practice.\n- The paper further analyzes possible attacks against the watermarking protocol and proposes a more secure instantiation strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Critique\nThe paper provides a comprehensive overview of the proposed branch backdoor-based model watermarking protocol and offers a detailed analysis of its implementation for language models. However, there are several potential issues and areas for improvement:\n1. **Complexity of Cryptographic Primitives:** The use of advanced cryptographic primitives like MAC and ECDSA may introduce complexity and potential implementation challenges in practical scenarios, which should be addressed.\n2. **Practical Implementation Challenges:** The paper should address the practicality and potential challenges of implementing the proposed model watermarking protocol in real-world scenarios, considering factors such as computational overhead and resource constraints.\n3. **Evaluation and Validation:** While the paper outlines the theoretical aspects of the protocol, it would benefit from empirical validation and testing in real-world settings to demonstrate its effectiveness and practical utility.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a comprehensive theoretical framework for a performance-lossless branch watermarking protocol, but it could benefit from addressing the practical implementation challenges and providing empirical evidence of its real-world performance.", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06488v1", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2312.06488v1", "abs": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06488v1"}, "authors": ["Na Zhao", "Kejiang Chen", "Weiming Zhang", "Nenghai Yu"], "title": "Performance-lossless Black-box Model Watermarking", "subtitle": "Propose watermarking protocol protects model IP with branch backdoor-based method, verified with language generation task.", "categories": ["robustness"], "publish_date": "2023-12-11", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "image": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2312.06488v1/extracted/5288023/imgs/threat.png", "word_count": 16235, "is_truncated": true}}

The interface aims to replicate the collaborative experience of working on a table in an online remote setting, utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning for voice and gesture recognition. The system's performance was evaluated through user studies, revealing both the potential and drawbacks of the proposed interface.\n\n### Main Findings\n\n1. **Multi-Modal Collaboration**: TeamCAD provides a user-friendly interface that enables remote collaboration in design processes through a combination of **speech and gesture recognition**. This approach aims to replicate the interactive and participatory nature of in-person design collaboration.\n\n2. **Challenges with Speech Recognition**: While the multimodal approach proved to be beneficial for users with varying levels of experience, **speech recognition** posed challenges, particularly in terms of robustness and responsiveness. The limitations of the speech recognition system affected the overall usability and efficiency of the interface.\n\n3. **User Studies and Performance Evaluation**: User studies conducted at different phases revealed insights into the performance and user experience of TeamCAD. The interface showed promise in equalizing the design process for users with varying skill levels, but also highlighted the need for further improvements in **speech recognition**.\n\n### System Description\n\n- **Speech and Gesture Recognition**: The system relies on speech recognition using the SpeechRecognition Python library, with real-time webcam gesture recognition using MediaPipe. This allows users to utilize voice commands and gestures to interact with a three-dimensional modeling or CAD software.\n\n- **Interface Operation**: TeamCAD uses a heads-up display (HUD) to present a library of voice commands and allows users to manipulate objects through gestures, such as using pinching gestures for selection and grabbing. The system also enables users to issue voice commands for specific transformations and manipulations.\n\n### User Studies and Performance\n\n- **Experimental Phases**: The user studies were conducted in three iterative phases, focusing on prototype, implementation, and final studio phases. The experiments involved tasks such as creating an arch in Blender 3D, recording users' interactions, and measuring time spent on different activities.\n\n- **Performance Evaluation**: Users spent varying amounts of time on different tasks, with manipulating objects and using speech recognition occupying a substantial amount of time. The results showed that speech recognition was less efficient and posed challenges related to robustness and usability.\n\n### Critique\n\nWhile TeamCAD demonstrates the potential for multimodal interfaces in remote collaborative design, the paper acknowledges several challenges, particularly in the area of **speech recognition**. The limitations and biases observed in the performance of speech recognition algorithms need to be addressed to ensure a more robust and user-friendly interface. Additionally, the reliance on third-party libraries and technologies may introduce dependencies and potential compatibility issues in real-world applications.

The findings suggest that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating advanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed neurons with similar semantics. The paper highlights the challenges of permanent concept removal for improved model safety and the importance of monitoring concept reemergence and developing techniques to mitigate relearning of unsafe concepts.\n\n## Introduction\nLarge language models encode semantic concepts across different languages, architectures, and modalities. The primary objective when pruning such models is to eliminate redundant neurons while preserving the most crucial ones, leading to the assumption that removing important \u201cconcept neurons\u201d will disrupt the model\u2019s structured internal representation of key concepts. However, the paper presents evidence of neuroplasticity in models, allowing them to regain high performance after pruning random or important neurons. This phenomenon, termed \u201cneuroplasticity,\u201d demonstrates a degree of adaptability in such models and has significant implications for model editing.\n\n## Related Work\nThe paper builds on previous works that have analyzed the distribution of concept representations in LLMs and studied performance recovery after pruning. It is noted that prior works artificially redistributed concepts in large language models by modifying the activations of specific neurons, but there is limited understanding of how concept redistribution naturally occurs after pruning. The study also compares its approach with similar works in the field.\n\n## Problem Setting\nThe paper provides a formal definition of concept neurons, concept saliency, and concept similarity, and outlines the process for identifying and pruning top concept neurons in a language model to induce neuroplasticity.\n\n## Method\nThe researchers explore neuroplasticity within a pretrained model by fine-tuning the model for a specific task, identifying and pruning concept neurons, and tracking the redistribution of concepts over the retraining process. They explore the concept saliency and similarity to analyze the redistribution of concepts in the model after neuroplasticity.\n\n## Experimental Setup\nThe study focuses on pruning the specific concept of location names from different LLMs and analyzes the models across different runs. The model architectures, training, and evaluations are clearly described.\n\n## Results\nThe paper presents a detailed analysis of the rapid performance recovery after retraining, high-level concept redistribution, and the relocation of pruned concepts. It also delves into the polysemantic characteristics of neurons after retraining.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how language models learn, adapt, and retain core conceptual representations. It also suggests potential research directions in model editing and transfer learning. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for studying the implications of neuroplasticity-induced polysemanticity to aid the development of interpretable models and the enhanced transfer of learned representations.\n\n## Critique\nThe paper provides valuable insights into neuroplasticity and concept reshaping in LLMs. However, the precise relationship between concept similarity and saliency and the generalizability of the findings to other LLMs require further investigation. Additionally, the paper acknowledges the potential wider impacts of its findings and emphasizes the importance of ethical and responsible AI research.", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01814v1", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2401.01814v1", "abs": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01814v1"}, "authors": ["Michelle Lo", "Shay B.
