The academic article "Dense Reward for Free in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback" introduces a method called Attention Based Credit (ABC) to improve Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) training. The article demonstrates that ABC leads to faster and more stable training and may result in better local optima. The article also discusses the theoretical equivalence of ABC to potential-based reward shaping, ensuring that the optimal policy remains unchanged. The experiments conducted in the article show that ABC improves the reward obtained faster and creates more consistency during training than vanilla RLHF. Additionally, ABC achieves higher reward at lower KL divergences than vanilla RLHF.
