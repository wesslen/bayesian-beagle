### **Summary:**
- Treatment planning in radiotherapy is time-consuming and resource demanding.
- Dose-volume histogram (DVH) prediction is critical for automating this process.
- This study explores the potential of deep learning models for predicting DVHs using images and large-language models (LLMs).
- A novel Dose Graph Neural Network (DoseGNN) model is developed for predicting DVHs from structured graphs.
- The proposed DoseGNN is enhanced with LLMs to encode knowledge from prescriptions and interactive instructions from clinicians.
- DoseGNN achieved mean square errors that were significantly lower than other widely-employed deep learning models used in radiotherapy.

### Major Findings:
1. DoseGNN achieved significantly lower mean square errors compared to other deep learning models used in radiotherapy.
2. The proposed DoseGNN model facilitates seamless adjustment to treatment plans through interaction with clinicians using natural language.
3. The study demonstrated the advantage of DoseGNN over existing deep learning models in predicting DVHs from images.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study addresses the limitations of data-driven deep learning models for automatic treatment planning, such as the scarcity of high-quality treatment plans for training.
- The proposed online Human-AI collaboration (OHAC) system aims to overcome the challenge of limited training data by enabling clinicians to interact with deep learning models for continuous improvement.
- The study also highlights the need for further research to generate deliverable IMRT plans based on predicted dose distributions.

Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the potential of deep learning models and LLMs in automating intensity-modulated radiotherapy planning. However, further research and practical implementation are necessary to address the identified limitations and challenges.
