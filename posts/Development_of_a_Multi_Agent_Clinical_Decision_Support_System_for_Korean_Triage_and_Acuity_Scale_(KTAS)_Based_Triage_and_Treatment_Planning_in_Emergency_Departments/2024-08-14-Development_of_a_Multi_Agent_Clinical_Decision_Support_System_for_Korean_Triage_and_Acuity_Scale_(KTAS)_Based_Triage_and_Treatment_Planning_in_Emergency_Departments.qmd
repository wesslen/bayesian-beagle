### Summary:

The study presents a multi-agent clinical decision support system (CDSS) for Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS)-based triage and treatment planning in emergency departments. The system utilizes Llama-3-70b as the base large language model (LLM), orchestrated by CrewAI and Langchain. It comprises four AI agents emulating key ED roles: Triage Nurse, Emergency Physician, Pharmacist, and ED Coordinator. The model was evaluated using the Asclepius dataset, with performance assessed by a clinical emergency medicine specialist. The CDSS demonstrated high accuracy in triage decision-making compared to the baseline of a single-agent system. The system also exhibited strong performance in critical areas, including primary diagnosis, critical findings identification, disposition decision-making, treatment planning, and resource allocation.

### Major Findings:

1. The multi-agent CDSS demonstrated high accuracy in KTAS-based triage and clinical decision-making, outperforming a single-agent system.
2. The system's performance was evaluated by a clinical emergency medicine specialist using the Asclepius dataset, which comprises simulated emergency department scenarios.
3. The multi-agent CDSS showed strong performance in critical areas, including primary diagnosis, critical findings identification, disposition decision-making, treatment planning, and resource allocation.

### Analysis and Critique:

The study presents a promising approach to addressing the challenges of emergency department overcrowding and the complexity of rapid decision-making in critical care settings. The use of LLMs in a multi-agent CDSS offers new possibilities for enhancing triage accuracy and clinical decision-making. However, the study has some limitations. The evaluation was based on a single dataset, and the performance of the system in real-world emergency departments remains to be seen. Additionally, the study does not address potential biases or ethical considerations that may arise from the use of LLMs in clinical decision-making. Further research is needed to evaluate the system's performance in diverse clinical settings and to address potential ethical and bias-related issues.
