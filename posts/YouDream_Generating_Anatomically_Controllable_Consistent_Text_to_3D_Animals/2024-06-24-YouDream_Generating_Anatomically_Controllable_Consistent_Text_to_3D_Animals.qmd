Summary:

YouDream is a method for generating high-quality anatomically controllable 3D animals. It is guided by a text-to-image diffusion model controlled by 2D views of a 3D pose prior. The method generates 3D animals that are not possible to create using previous text-to-3D generative methods and preserves anatomic consistency. A fully automated pipeline for generating commonly found animals is also proposed, which uses a multi-agent LLM to adapt poses from a limited library of animal 3D poses to represent the desired animal. A user study conducted on the outcomes of YouDream demonstrates the preference of the animal models generated by this method over others.

Major Findings:

1. YouDream generates high-quality 3D animals based on any 3D skeleton, utilizing a 2D pose-controlled diffusion model that generates images adhering to 2D views of a 3D pose.
2. The method generates anatomically and geometrically consistent animals, outperforming previous text-to-3D approaches that often struggle with anatomic consistency.
3. A fully automated pipeline for generating commonly found animals is proposed, which uses a multi-agent LLM to adapt poses from a limited library of animal 3D poses to represent the desired animal.

Analysis and Critique:

1. The method relies on a limited library of animal 3D poses, which may not be able to represent all possible animal shapes and poses.
2. The method does not address the issue of generating 3D animals from text descriptions alone, which is a common use case for text-to-3D generative models.
3. The user study conducted to evaluate the method only included a small number of participants and may not be representative of the general population.
4. The method does not provide a way to control the level of detail or realism of the generated 3D animals, which may be important for certain applications.
5. The method does not address the issue of generating 3D animals with complex or non-rigid deformations, which is a challenging problem in 3D generation.
