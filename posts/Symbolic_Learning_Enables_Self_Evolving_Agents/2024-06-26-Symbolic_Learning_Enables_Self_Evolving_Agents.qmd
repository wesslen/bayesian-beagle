### Summary:

The paper introduces a novel framework called agent symbolic learning, which enables language agents to optimize themselves in a data-centric way using symbolic optimizers. This framework treats agents as symbolic networks, where learnable weights are defined by prompts, tools, and their stacking. The agent symbolic learning framework is designed to optimize the symbolic network within language agents by mimicking two fundamental algorithms in connectionist learning: back-propagation and gradient descent. However, instead of dealing with numeric weights, it works with natural language simulacrums of weights, loss, and gradients. The paper presents proof-of-concept experiments on both standard benchmarks and complex real-world tasks, demonstrating that agent symbolic learning enables language agents to update themselves after being created and deployed in the wild, resulting in "self-evolving agents".

### Major Findings:

1. The agent symbolic learning framework enables language agents to optimize themselves in a data-centric way, mimicking the back-propagation and gradient descent algorithms used in connectionist learning.
2. The framework treats agents as symbolic networks, where learnable weights are defined by prompts, tools, and their stacking.
3. The framework uses natural language simulacrums of weights, loss, and gradients, rather than numeric weights.
4. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that agent symbolic learning enables language agents to update themselves after being created and deployed in the wild, resulting in "self-evolving agents".

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper presents an innovative approach to optimizing language agents, which could potentially lead to more robust and versatile agents.
2. The use of natural language simulacrums of weights, loss, and gradients is a novel approach, but it may introduce additional complexity and potential sources of error.
3. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other optimization methods, which could help to better understand the advantages and limitations of the proposed framework.
4. The experiments are limited to proof-of-concept studies, and further research is needed to evaluate the performance of the framework in more complex and diverse scenarios.
5. The paper does not discuss potential ethical implications of self-evolving agents, which is an important consideration in the development of AI systems
