**Summary:**

The paper proposes a method to enhance medication recommendation by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for text representation. The method aims to increase the utilization of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as clinical notes, which contain complex terminology. The proposed method can be applied to existing base models and improve medication recommendation performance with the combination representation of text and medical codes. The experiments conducted on two different datasets demonstrate that LLM text representation alone can even demonstrate a comparable ability to medical code representation alone.

**Major Findings:**

1. The proposed method of using LLM text representation for medication recommendation can improve the performance of existing base models.
2. The combination representation of text and medical codes can maintain performance at a certain level.
3. The LLM text representation contains valuable information for medication recommendation, and its combination with medical code embeddings maintains performance at a certain level.
