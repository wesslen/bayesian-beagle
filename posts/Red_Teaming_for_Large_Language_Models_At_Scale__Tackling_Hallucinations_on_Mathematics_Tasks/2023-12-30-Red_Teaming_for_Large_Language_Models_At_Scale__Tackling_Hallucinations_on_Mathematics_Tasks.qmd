### Major Findings

1. Red teaming LLMs on elementary calculations and algebraic tasks revealed that **gpt-3.5-turbo** and **gpt-4 models** are not well suited for these tasks, even when red teamed. 
2. **Structured reasoning and providing worked-out examples** were found to slow down the deterioration of the quality of answers but did not significantly improve the performance of the models.
3. The models' numerical abilities seemed to stem mostly from **memorization**, rather than their ability to follow simple algorithms.

### Introduction

- Red teaming is used to systematically find backdoors in Large Language Models (LLMs) to elicit irresponsible responses.
- Red teaming at scale can be challenging as the modelâ€™s answers often require manual verification, especially in contexts involving potential harm.

### Related Work

- **Safety of LLMs**: Modern LLMs are far from safe, and are prone to hallucinations, posing significant threats.
- **Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs**: Previous work has shown that advanced LLMs tend to be inconsistent on mathematics tasks.

### Methods

- The study uses the gpt-4 and gpt-3.5-turbo models accessed through the OpenAI API to evaluate their performance on mathematics tasks.
- They develop a Python framework for automatic red teaming at scale and conduct two experiments: Elementary Mathematics and Algebraic Reasoning.

### Results

- **Experiment 1**: Easy calculations were completed with high accuracy, while the performance on harder calculations dropped significantly. Red teaming techniques generally degraded the models' performance.
- **Experiment 2**: Providing examples led to an increase in performance on almost all metrics, with some techniques benefiting more than others.

### Discussion

- The findings suggest that the models are generally not suited for mathematics tasks, and at best, red teaming techniques slightly improved performance.
- Prompts with red teaming tended to be much longer, likely detracting from the problem at hand.

### Conclusion and Limitations

- The study develops a Python framework for automatic red teaming of LLMs at scale and evaluates two GPT models at school-level calculations and puzzles.
- **Limitations**: The evaluation only covers one type of LLM and the training data is not publicly available.

### Critique

The paper provides valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in handling elementary mathematics and algebraic reasoning tasks. However, potential problems and limitations include:

- The study only uses two specific LLM models, and the generalizability of the findings to other models may be limited.
- The paper does not delve into potential solutions or improvements to address the observed limitations in the models' performance.

Overall, while the study highlights important shortcomings of LLMs, further research is needed to address these limitations and develop more robust models for mathematical reasoning tasks.
