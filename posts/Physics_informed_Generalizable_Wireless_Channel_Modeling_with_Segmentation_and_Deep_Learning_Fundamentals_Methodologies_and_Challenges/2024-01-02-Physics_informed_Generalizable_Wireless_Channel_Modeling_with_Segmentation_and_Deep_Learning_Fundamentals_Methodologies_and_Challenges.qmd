### Major Takeaways

1. **Wireless Channel Modeling Importance**: Wireless channel modeling and estimation are critical for optimizing wireless communication systems, such as localization, frequency selection, coordinated site deployment, and antenna design.

2. **Challenges of Data-Driven Approaches**: Data-driven methods for wireless channel modeling often lack generalizability, robustness, and interpretability, especially in handling out-of-range data and complex scenarios.

3. **Advantages of PINN in Channel Modeling**: Physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based approaches show potential for improved generalization, efficiency, and interpretability in wireless channel modeling.


### I Introduction

- Wireless channel modeling is crucial for applications in wireless communication, and precise parameters allow for optimization and performance improvement.
- The mathematical representation of a wireless channel is characterized by its channel impulse response in the time domain, consisting of multipath components.
- Stochastic and deterministic channel models are the two primary methods for channel modeling.


### II Modeling Radio Propagation with ML: An Overview

- ML-assisted channel modeling utilizes input, ML models, and output to capture non-linear input-output relationships characteristic of real-world conditions.
- Input data can take various formats, and ML models, such as CNNs and RNNs, have been applied in radio propagation scenarios.
- ML-based approaches have been used for tasks like radio map estimation, scenario identification, and application-specific prediction of implicit channels.


### III Physics-Informed ML Modeling Methodologies

- Physics-informed NN (PINN) integration into channel modeling can offer improved generalization, efficiency, and interpretability.
- Several recent works have explored generalizable channel modeling with PINN, including radio map prediction, spatial signal prediction, and ray-surface interaction using NN.


### IV A Case Study with Physics-Informed Indoor Propagation Modelling

- A case study with PINN demonstrates precise indoor multipath component (MPC) prediction using segmentation and knowledge distillation, providing an effective workflow for PINN modeling.


### V Challenges and Future Directions

- Challenges for PINN channel modeling include limited high-resolution datasets, gaps between simulation and measurement, and the need for deep integration of PINN with radio propagation.
- Future opportunities include the development of digital twin dataset generators and large ML models for channel modeling.


### VI Conclusion

- The paper presents the limitations of data-driven methods, the advantages of PINN-based modeling, a case study of indoor propagation modeling, and challenges and opportunities for future research in channel modeling.

### Critique

The paper effectively highlights the benefits of PINN-based channel modeling and provides a comprehensive overview of the field. However, the absence of specific quantitative results from the case study limits the ability to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Additionally, the discussion on future opportunities could be more detailed and provide clearer paths for researchers to pursue. Overall, further empirical evidence and clarity on future research directions would strengthen the paper's contribution to the field.
