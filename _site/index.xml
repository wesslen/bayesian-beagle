  <dc:creator>Wenqi Zhang, Yongliang Shen, Linjuan Wu, Qiuying Peng, Jun Wang, Yueting Zhuang, Weiming Lu</dc:creator>
  <link>https://bayesian-beagle.netlify.app/posts/Self_Contrast_Better_Reflection_Through_Inconsistent_Solving_Perspectives/2024-01-04-Self_Contrast_Better_Reflection_Through_Inconsistent_Solving_Perspectives.html</link>

<section id="summary" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Self-Contrast: Better Reflection Through Inconsistent Solving Perspectives</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Major Findings</strong> - <strong>Intrinsic Reflection Deficiencies</strong>: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with self-correction due to ineffective intrinsic reflection. - <strong>Overconfident and Inconsistent Feedback</strong>: LLMs often exhibit overconfidence (46.7%) or inconsistency (45.7%) when self-evaluating, hindering accurate self-reflection. - <strong>Self-Contrast Approach</strong>: The Self-Contrast method, which involves creating diverse solving perspectives and contrasting the differences, significantly improves LLMs’ reflection capabilities across reasoning and translation tasks.</p>
<p><strong>2. Evaluation of Intrinsic Reflection</strong> - <strong>Limited Reflection Capability</strong>: LLMs show insignificant performance gains from reflection and struggle to correct incorrect initial responses. - <strong>Feedback Analysis</strong>: The self-evaluate process results in overconfident and inconsistent feedback, impeding effective reflection.</p>
<p><strong>3. Self-Contrast</strong> - <strong>Create Diverse Perspectives</strong>: LLMs autonomously generate multiple prompts tailored to the user’s request, fostering diverse solving perspectives. - <strong>Contrast Inter-Perspective Discrepancies</strong>: LLM contrasts the differences between responses, identifying errors and providing re-examining instructions. - <strong>Eliminate Discrepancies</strong>: Discrepancies between perspectives guide LLMs to revise inconsistent responses for more accurate reflection.</p>

<section id="critique" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="critique">Critique</h3>
<p>The paper presents a novel approach, but it may benefit from a discussion on potential limitations and challenges in implementing the Self-Contrast method. Additionally, further exploration of real-world application and scalability would enhance the paper’s practical significance. Moreover, a comparison with existing state-of-the-art reflection strategies could provide a better understanding of the method’s effectiveness.</p>

  <title>LLM Augmented LLMs: Expanding Capabilities through Composition</title>
  <dc:creator>Rachit Bansal, Bidisha Samanta, Siddharth Dalmia, Nitish Gupta, Shikhar Vashishth, Sriram Ganapathy, Abhishek Bapna, Prateek Jain, Partha Talukdar</dc:creator>
  <link>https://bayesian-beagle.netlify.app/posts/LLM_Augmented_LLMs_Expanding_Capabilities_through_Composition/2024-01-04-LLM_Augmented_LLMs_Expanding_Capabilities_through_Composition.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p><img src="https://bayesian-beagle.netlify.app/posts/LLM_Augmented_LLMs_Expanding_Capabilities_through_Composition/https:/browse.arxiv.org/html/2401.02412v1/x1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Major Takeaways</strong> - The paper introduces the concept of Composition to Augment Language Models (CALM) which enables the composition of existing foundational language models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities. - The CALM framework introduces cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities, allowing for the reuse of existing models with established capabilities. - The paper demonstrates the practical applications of CALM in language inclusivity and code generation, showing significant improvements in translation, arithmetic reasoning, and code-related tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong> - Large Language Models (LLMs) have foundational capabilities and have been fine-tuned for domain-specific capabilities, resulting in the development of several specialized large models with domain-specific capabilities. - The paper aims to enable the composition of an anchor model with a domain-specific augmenting model to enable new capabilities, such as composing an augmenting model’s code understanding capability with an anchor LLM’s language generation capability to enable code-to-text generation capability.</p>
<p><strong>The CALM Framework</strong> - CALM aims to compose an anchor model and an augmenting model to enable new capabilities as a composition of capabilities of the two individual models. - It operates over a selected set of layers from the anchor and augmenting models and introduces a small number of trainable parameters over these layers. - The composition training data depicts a “combined skill” of the given models for the target composition domain and is used to learn the composition parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Experiments</strong> - The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of CALM in three domains: key-value arithmetic, low-resource language inclusivity, and code completion and explanation tasks. - The experiments show the significant improvements achieved by composing an augmenting model with an anchor LLM, surpassing the individual models and versions that have been fine-tuned for the specific tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Critique</strong> - The paper lacks a discussion on the potential limitations or challenges of the CALM framework, such as its scalability to larger models or its adaptability to diverse languages and domains. - The experimental results could benefit from a more extensive comparison with other relevant methods or frameworks to establish the unique advantages of CALM.</p>

<section id="summary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><strong>DCR-Consistency: Divide-Conquer-Reasoning for Consistency Evaluation and Improvement of Large Language Models</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Findings</strong>
<ul>
<li>The paper proposes a new framework, DCR, for evaluating and improving the consistency of Large Language Model (LLM)-generated texts which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in semantic, factual, and summarization consistency tasks.</li>
<li>The framework employs three components: Divide-Conquer Evaluator (DCE), Auto-Metric Converter (AMC), and Reason-Assisted Improver (RAI) to evaluate and improve the consistency of generated responses.</li>
<li>The DCR framework demonstrates high correlations with human judgments, reduces output inconsistencies, and shows promise for effective hallucination mitigation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Preliminaries</strong>
<ul>
<li>Conventional evaluation methods relying on token-level comparison fail to capture overall semantic meaning, leading to low correlation with human judgments.</li>
<li>The consistency of LLMs is essential for AI safety and reliability, but current methods often overlook self-consistency failures.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Divide-Conquer-Reasoning</strong>
<ul>
<li>DCE evaluates semantic consistency between reference and candidate paragraphs at a sentence level using a divide-and-conquer strategy.</li>
<li>AMC converts the evaluation reasons into a numeric score for quantitative interpretation.</li>
<li>RAI utilizes the outputs of DCE to generate new responses to mitigate inconsistencies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Experiments</strong>
<ul>
<li>The DCR framework outperforms baseline methods in semantic, factual, and summarization consistency evaluations, showing high correlations with human judgment.</li>
<li>RAI significantly improves consistency, reducing nearly 90% of output inconsistencies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="critique" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="critique">Critique</h2>
<p>While the DCR framework shows promise in evaluating and improving LLM-generated texts’ consistency, several limitations should be considered.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not Comprehensive</strong>: The approach may not universally address all dimensions of text evaluation, such as coherence and relevance.</li>
<li><strong>Input Dependence</strong>: The accuracy of the framework is inherently limited by the correctness of the input paragraphs, potentially affecting the detection of non-factual statements.</li>
<li><strong>Manual Prompting</strong>: The requirement for hand-crafted prompts for specific tasks may limit the scalability and automation of the framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into consistency evaluation and improvement for LLM-generated texts, but further research is needed to address the identified limitations.</p>

<h1>Learning to Prompt with Text Only Supervision for Vision-Language Models</h1>
<section id="abstract" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract:</h2>
<p>Vision-language models such as CLIP have shown excellent generalization abilities, but adapting these models for downstream tasks while maintaining their generalization remains a challenge. In this work, the authors propose a method, ProText, which learns prompts using only text data derived from large language models (LLMs). This approach enables zero-shot transfer of prompts to new classes and datasets, potentially reducing the LLM prompt engineering cost. Extensive evaluations show that ProText improves upon prior ensembling works and is competitive with those utilizing labeled images.</p>

<h1>Critique</h1>
<p>The paper presents an innovative approach that addresses the challenges of adapting CLIP for downstream tasks.

  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p><img src="https://bayesian-beagle.netlify.app/posts/Economics_Arena_for_Large_Language_Models/https:/browse.arxiv.org/html/2401.01735v1/x1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>he mean deviation distance of player i𝑖iitalic_i; and N, the total number of players. When with history, LLMs are expected to bring down their mean deviation distances compared to without history, otherwise it is a reflection of a failure in learning from the past information. For competitive game theoretic reasoning, a lower mean deviation distance, where players are closer to following the NE, implies playing more rational strategies.</p>
<p>A.3.2 Adaptation to Dynamic Environments</p>
<p>In a dynamic environment, it is expected that the strategic ability of the agents would be put to test. The variation in game configurations would change transfer payoffs from one model to another. Furthermore, as configurations change, rationality is a quality of updating the strategy, and also of consistency of the strategy till it faces a more aggressive agent in the next round. Thus, strategic reasoning could be surmised from the consistency of the strategies across various game configurations and more so, varying player configurations. If a player has higher adaptive strategies, there would be a different quality of strategies over different adversaries, thus their mean deviation distances should be lower when playing with other players than when rationality assumption is already in place.</p>
<p>A.3.3 Strategic Reasoning through Game History</p>
<p>With game history available, it is expected that the average payoff and deviation distance from NE would reduce, given that agents learn from their past experiences, or learn quickly to achieve a similar level of rationality as when a rationality assumption is already in place. We expect, with history, models that have optimal strategy which are robust to the varying ranges to have much lower deviation distances than models with relatively more volatile strategies, and then to observe convergence over runs. We note that the faster the rate of convergence is, the higher the rationality of the agents, thus stronger realization of Nash equilibria.</p>
<p>A.3.4 Natural Language Instructions Following Behaviours of LLMs</p>
<p>It is essential for LLM-based agents to strictly follow the instructions described by the natural languages, as predicting and following commands is a task of everyday importance&nbsp;(Bender and Koller, 2020). The goal of this study is also to investigate the performance of these models in strictly adhering to natural language instructions. We will be calculating the frequency of rule-breaking and comparing it across the different LLM-based agents across the two game types as an insight into their ability in comprehending instructions in different contexts. The results would reflect their natural language understanding capabilities, and the ability to differentiate and execute different instructions based on the contexts.</p>
<p>A.3.5 Other Variations</p>
<p>The performance of a model is not only determined by the dynamics of the agent itself, but also by other factors such as the agent’s memory capacity, and the temporal structure of the promp. To investigate the impact of Chain-of-Thought and variation in prompt language, we ran some of the same experiments under these variations and compared them to the main results. The findings will demonstrate the importance of these factors in shaping the performance of the LLMs and whether these variations can improve the strategic reasoning ability of the LLMs in the economics arena.</p>

<h1>Large Language Models Relearn Removed Concepts</h1>
<section id="major-takeaways" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="major-takeaways">Major Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Neuroplasticity</strong>: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to quickly regain performance and redistribute pruned concepts after retraining.</li>
<li><strong>Concept Redistribution</strong>: Pruned concepts originally present in later layers are remapped to neurons in earlier layers, demonstrating the resilience of LLMs.</li>
<li><strong>Polysemantic Capacities</strong>: Neurons show polysemantic properties, capturing a blend of old and new concepts during relearning.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="abstract" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The study investigates neuroplasticity in large language models (LLMs) by exploring their capacity to reacquire pruned concepts after editing. The findings suggest that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating advanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed neurons with similar semantics. The paper highlights the challenges of permanent concept removal for improved model safety and the importance of monitoring concept reemergence and developing techniques to mitigate relearning of unsafe concepts.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Large language models encode semantic concepts across different languages, architectures, and modalities. The primary objective when pruning such models is to eliminate redundant neurons while preserving the most crucial ones, leading to the assumption that removing important “concept neurons” will disrupt the model’s structured internal representation of key concepts. However, the paper presents evidence of neuroplasticity in models, allowing them to regain high performance after pruning random or important neurons. This phenomenon, termed “neuroplasticity,” demonstrates a degree of adaptability in such models and has significant implications for model editing.</p>
</section>
<section id="related-work" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="related-work">Related Work</h2>
<p>The paper builds on previous works that have analyzed the distribution of concept representations in LLMs and studied performance recovery after pruning. It is noted that prior works artificially redistributed concepts in large language models by modifying the activations of specific neurons, but there is limited understanding of how concept redistribution naturally occurs after pruning. The study also compares its approach with similar works in the field.</p>
</section>
<section id="problem-setting" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problem-setting">Problem Setting</h2>
<p>The paper provides a formal definition of concept neurons, concept saliency, and concept similarity, and outlines the process for identifying and pruning top concept neurons in a language model to induce neuroplasticity.</p>
</section>
<section id="method" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="method">Method</h2>
<p>The researchers explore neuroplasticity within a pretrained model by fine-tuning the model for a specific task, identifying and pruning concept neurons, and tracking the redistribution of concepts over the retraining process. They explore the concept saliency and similarity to analyze the redistribution of concepts in the model after neuroplasticity.</p>
</section>
<section id="experimental-setup" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="experimental-setup">Experimental Setup</h2>
<p>The study focuses on pruning the specific concept of location names from different LLMs and analyzes the models across different runs. The model architectures, training, and evaluations are clearly described.</p>
</section>
<section id="results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results">Results</h2>
<p>The paper presents a detailed analysis of the rapid performance recovery after retraining, high-level concept redistribution, and the relocation of pruned concepts. It also delves into the polysemantic characteristics of neurons after retraining.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how language models learn, adapt, and retain core conceptual representations. It also suggests potential research directions in model editing and transfer learning. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for studying the implications of neuroplasticity-induced polysemanticity to aid the development of interpretable models and the enhanced transfer of learned representations.</p>
</section>
<section id="critique" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="critique">Critique</h2>
<p>The paper provides valuable insights into neuroplasticity and concept reshaping in LLMs. However, the precise relationship between concept similarity and saliency and the generalizability of the findings to other LLMs require further investigation. Additionally, the paper acknowledges the potential wider impacts of its findings and emphasizes the importance of ethical and responsible AI research.</p>

</ol>
</section>
<section id="summary" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation</strong>
<ul>
<li>LLMs face notable challenges in highly specialized fields such as astronomy due to their propensity to align with general concepts and infrequent updates to their training datasets resulting in a delay in assimilating recent astronomical advancements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>AstroLLaMA-Chat</strong>
<ul>
<li>AstroLLaMA-Chat is an advanced version of AstroLLaMA trained on introductions, conclusions, and abstracts of astronomy papers, alongside a domain-specific dialogue dataset. The model is fine-tuned using a diverse mix of datasets.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Training</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fine-tuning on the LLaMA-2 models is executed using the LMFlow LLM-training framework, incorporating advanced techniques like Flash Attention, ZeRO Optimization, and long-context techniques.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>
<ul>
<li>While general-purpose models like GPT-4 and LLaMA-2 demonstrate robust reasoning and a good general understanding of astronomy, continual pre-training with limited resources can yield competitive and, in certain specific cases, superior performance, particularly in highly specialized topics.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="major-findings" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="major-findings">Major Findings</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Generalist embedding models outperformed specialized clinical embedding models</strong> in a semantic search task, suggesting that clinical models are more sensitive to small changes in input that confuse them. This sensitivity may be due to inadequate training data and a lack of diverse datasets necessary for reliable global language understanding in the medical domain.</li>
<li>The best performing embedding models for short-context clinical semantic search were jina-embeddings-v2-base-en, e5-small-v2, and e5-large-v2, all of which are <strong>generalist models</strong>.</li>
<li>The experiment highlighted the need for an appropriate training phase that matches the final needs, indicating that <strong>generalist sentence-transformer models</strong> were more accurate than specialized models even in a clinical context.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="methodology" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Generated dataset</strong>: A dataset based on ICD-10-CM code descriptions was constructed, consisting of 100 codes with ten reformulations for each, which was made publicly available.</li>
<li><strong>Semantic search</strong>: The retrieval of top one code description and associated code using embedding models was evaluated using performance metrics, including exact matching, category matching, and character error rate (CER).</li>
<li><strong>Embedding models</strong>: A total of 19 embedding models, including both generalist and clinical models, were used for the benchmarking experiment.</li>
<li><strong>Metrics</strong>: Performance was assessed based on exact matching, category matching, and CER, with a focus on the average of all reformulations and distinguishing between total CER and incorrect CER.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="results" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results">Results</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>top performing</strong> embedding models for short-context clinical semantic search were generalist models, with jina-embeddings-v2-base-en, e5-small-v2, and e5-large-v2 exhibiting the highest performance.</li>
<li>Visual performance analysis indicated that a smaller embedding vector size was associated with higher performance, particularly for exact matching rate and incorrect CER metrics.</li>
<li>The study presented selected examples of top performing generalist and clinical embedding models, highlighting the superiority of generalist models in terms of exact matching rates.</li>
</ul>

<section id="critique" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="critique">Critique</h3>
<p>The study provides valuable insights into the performance of generalist and specialized embedding models in a clinical semantic search tasks. However, the limitations of the study include: - The focus on short-context semantic search may not fully generalize to longer medical texts or broader clinical tasks. - The study did not include fully clinical sentence-transformer embedding models, which could impact the overall comparison and conclusions. - The reproducibility of the results may be limited by the selection of embedding models based on computational resources and availability, potentially leading to biases in the model comparison.</p>
