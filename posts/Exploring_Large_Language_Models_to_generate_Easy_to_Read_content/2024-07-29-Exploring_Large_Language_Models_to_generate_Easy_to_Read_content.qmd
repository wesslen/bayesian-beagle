### Summary:

This research explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to systematically simplify Spanish texts into Easy to Read formats, focusing on utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating Easy to Read content. The study contributes a parallel corpus of Spanish adapted for Easy To Read format and conducts text simplification experiments using LLMs and the collected corpus. A qualitative evaluation, guided by an expert in text adaptation for Easy to Read content, is carried out to assess the automatically simplified texts. This research aims to advance text accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments and highlights responsible management of energy usage in LLMs.

### Major Findings:

1. The study presents an exploratory investigation into leveraging AI and NLP approaches to support the systematic simplification of Spanish texts, focusing on Easy to Read guidelines and resources.
2. A parallel corpus of Spanish adapted for Easy To Read format is created, serving as a valuable resource for training and testing text simplification systems.
3. Several text simplification experiments using LLMs and the collected corpus are conducted, involving fine-tuning and testing a Llama2 model to generate Easy to Read content.
4. A qualitative evaluation, guided by an expert in text adaptation for Easy to Read content, is carried out to assess the automatically simplified texts.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The research contributes to advancing text accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments, highlighting promising strategies for leveraging LLMs.
2. The study emphasizes the importance of responsible management of energy usage in LLMs, as they can have high energy consumption and associated costs.
3. The research focuses on Spanish texts, and the findings may not be directly applicable to other languages or cultures.
4. The study does not address the potential limitations or biases of LLMs in generating Easy to Read content, which could be a topic for future research.
5. The research does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different LLMs or text simplification techniques, which could be explored in future studies.
6. The study does not discuss the potential impact of LLMs on the job market for human text adaptation experts, which could be an important consideration for future research.
