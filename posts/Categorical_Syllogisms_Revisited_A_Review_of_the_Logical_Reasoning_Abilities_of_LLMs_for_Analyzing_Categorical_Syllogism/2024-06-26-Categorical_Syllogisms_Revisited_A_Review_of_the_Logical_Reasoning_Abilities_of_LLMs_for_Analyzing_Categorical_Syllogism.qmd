**Summary:**

This paper provides a systematic overview of prior works on the logical reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) for analyzing categorical syllogisms. The authors investigate all possible variations of categorical syllogisms from a purely logical perspective and examine the underlying configurations tested by existing datasets. The results indicate that compared to template-based synthetic datasets, crowdsourcing approaches sacrifice the coverage of configurations for more language variations, thus bringing challenges to fully testing LLMs under different situations. The paper also summarizes the findings and observations for the performances of LLMs in inferring the validity of syllogisms from the current literature. The error rate breakdown analyses suggest that the interpretation of quantifiers is the current bottleneck that limits the performances of LLMs. Finally, the paper discusses several points that might be worth considering when researchers plan on the future release of categorical syllogism datasets.

**Major Findings:**

1. Compared to template-based synthetic datasets, crowdsourcing approaches sacrifice the coverage of configurations for more language variations, thus bringing challenges to fully testing LLMs under different situations.
2. The interpretation of quantifiers is the current bottleneck that limits the performances of LLMs in inferring the validity of syllogisms.
3. Future releases of categorical syllogism datasets should consider clarifying certain issues such as existential import, providing complete annotations, and building datasets containing ordinary arguments.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper provides a comprehensive review of the current literature regarding categorical syllogisms and the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. The authors' analysis of the limitations of existing datasets and the bottlenecks in LLMs' performance is insightful and valuable for future research. However, the paper does not provide a clear solution to the identified problems or propose new models to improve LLMs' performance. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential biases or methodological issues in the existing literature, which could be a limitation of the review. Overall, the paper is well-structured, coherent, and effectively communicates the essential information from the academic article.
