### Summary:

- Large language models (LLMs) have limitations in processing long contexts, slow inference speed, and high computing costs.
- Existing works rely on compressing long prompt contexts into soft prompts, but they encounter limitations in transferability across different LLMs, especially API-based LLMs.
- This work proposes a Natural Language Prompt Encapsulation (Nano-Capsulator) framework to compress original prompts into NL-formatted Capsule Prompt while maintaining prompt utility and transferability.
- The Capsule Prompt reduces 81.4% of the original length, decreases inference latency up to 4.5Ã—, and saves 80.1% of budget overheads.

### Major Findings:

1. The Nano-Capsulator framework effectively compresses original prompts into NL-formatted Capsule Prompt while maintaining prompt utility and transferability.
2. The Capsule Prompt significantly reduces the length, inference latency, and budget overheads of LLMs in processing long contexts.
3. The Nano-Capsulator framework demonstrates high transferability across diverse LLMs and different datasets.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The study focuses on compressing prompts into natural language format, which may not be as effective as other compression techniques in preserving the semantics of the original prompt.
- The evaluation is limited to two specific datasets, which may not be representative of all possible use cases and domains.
- The study could benefit from a more thorough analysis of the potential biases and limitations of the proposed framework.
- The Nano-Capsulator framework could be further improved by incorporating more sophisticated compression techniques and exploring other ways to maintain the semantics of the original prompt.

Overall, the Nano-Capsulator framework presents a promising approach to addressing the limitations of LLMs in processing long contexts. However, further research is needed to fully evaluate its effectiveness and potential applications.
