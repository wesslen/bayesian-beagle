### **Summary:**
This research paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance speaking skills. The authors present a novel LLM-based system, Comuniqa, for this task. They take a human-centric approach to evaluate this system, comparing it with human experts. The study investigates the possibility of combining feedback from both LLM and human experts to enhance overall learning outcomes. The preliminary findings suggest that while LLM-based systems have commendable accuracy, they lack human-level cognitive capabilities, both in terms of accuracy and empathy.

### Major Findings:
1. The study found that participants strongly preferred human experts for practicing English due to their ability to understand and empathize, which AI tools cannot yet recreate.
2. Participants appreciated the accuracy and comprehensive feedback provided by the LLM-based system, but still favored learning from human experts.
3. The study revealed that AI systems cannot match human cognition, both in terms of accuracy and in providing emotional support and empathetic responses.

### Analysis and Critique:
The study provides valuable insights into the integration of AI systems with human expertise in supporting language learning, specifically focusing on speaking skills. However, the study has limitations, including a short duration and a participant pool predominantly comprising engineering students within a specific age group. The absence of a robust framework addressing non-verbal communication skills within the Comuniqa app represents a notable limitation. Additionally, the study did not address the challenges of scheduling sessions with human experts. The study highlights the ongoing need for investigations and improvements in seamlessly integrating AI technologies into educational contexts. Further research is needed to explore the benefits of combining human expertise with AI systems to enhance the learning experience.
