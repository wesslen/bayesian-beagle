### **Summary:**
The article evaluates the effectiveness of GPT-4 Turbo in creating defeaters for assurance cases, which are structured arguments used to verify the correct implementation of non-functional requirements in systems. The study proposes a novel approach using GPT-4 Turbo to identify defeaters within assurance cases formalized using Eliminative Argumentation (EA) notation. The preliminary evaluation shows that GPT-4 Turbo is proficient in understanding and generating arguments in this context.

### **Major Findings:**
1. GPT-4 Turbo is proficient in understanding and generating arguments in EA notation.
2. The model is capable of generating different types of defeaters within assurance cases.
3. GPT-4 Turbo shows strong proficiency in creating EA elements, particularly various types of defeaters.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
The preliminary study reveals that GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates excellent proficiency in understanding and applying EA notation, particularly in generating different types of defeaters within assurance cases. However, the model's understanding of the semantics of EA elements was found to be less robust. This suggests the need for specific prompting techniques to enhance its comprehension of EA semantics. Overall, the study highlights the potential of GPT-4 Turbo as a valuable tool for identifying and mitigating defeaters within assurance cases, particularly in mission-critical systems. However, further research is needed to enhance the model's semantic understanding and to validate its effectiveness in identifying and mitigating defeaters in real-world scenarios.
