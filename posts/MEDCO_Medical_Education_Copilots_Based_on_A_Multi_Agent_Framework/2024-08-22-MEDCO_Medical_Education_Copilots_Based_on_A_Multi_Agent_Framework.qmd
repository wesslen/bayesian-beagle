# Summary:

The paper introduces MEDCO, a novel multi-agent-based copilot system designed to emulate real-world medical training environments. MEDCO incorporates three primary agents: an agentic patient, an expert doctor, and a radiologist, facilitating a multi-modal and interactive learning environment. The framework emphasizes the learning of proficient question-asking skills, multi-disciplinary collaboration, and peer discussions between students. The experiments show that simulated virtual students who underwent training with MEDCO achieved substantial performance enhancements comparable to those of advanced models, demonstrating human-like learning behaviors and improvements, coupled with an increase in the number of learning samples.

# Major Findings:

1. MEDCO is a multi-modal, multi-agent copilot designed to enhance medical students’ clinical conversion and diagnostic skills.
2. A new hierarchical evaluation metric for assessing diagnostic accuracy at coarse, medium, and fine-grained levels is proposed.
3. Agentic students trained with the copilot exhibit human-like learning behaviors, highlighting its potential for real-world application with actual students.

# Analysis and Critique:

While MEDCO shows promise in enhancing medical education, there are some potential limitations and areas for improvement:

1. The current study only simulates students using LLMs, and the effectiveness of MEDCO for helping human students in learning medical knowledge requires further investigation.
2. The memory mechanism used to represent a student’s learning and acquisition of new knowledge may not fully capture the complexity of human learning.
3. The current implementation of MEDCO only provides textual feedback from the medical expert, and future work can enable the expert to provide quintessential medical imaging examples to improve the student’s diagnostic skill and broaden their knowledge.
4. The capabilities of agentic doctors for multi-departmental collaboration can be expanded by granting them access to foundation AI models or specialized AI models as their tools.
5. A larger-scale multi-modal collaborative dataset is needed to unlock the full potential of the MEDCO system.
