### **Summary:**
- The research focuses on the integration of large language models (LLM) and multi-lingual machine translations (MMT) within the ethnic media industry, specifically targeting the Bangladeshi ethnic media in New York City.
- The study aims to empower US-based Bengali journalists with seamless access to critical news and information in their native language, bridging the gap between mainstream media and ethnic media through innovative news searching and translation solutions.
- The paper outlines a theoretical framework elucidating the integration of LLM and MMT into the news searching and translation processes for ethnic media, addressing potential ethical challenges associated with the incorporation of LLM and MMT in news translation procedures.

### Major Findings:
1. Ethnic media serves as an ethnic communityâ€™s access to mainstream media information, focusing on local events and news related to the diasporic community.
2. The Bangla AI algorithm promises to revolutionize ethnic media journalism practices in the USA by catering specifically to marginalized populations and enhancing their access to information.
3. The study offers a comprehensive framework for the entire news production process, encompassing every step from news selection to final production, utilizing LLM and MMT.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study presents a theoretical framework and algorithm for the integration of LLM and MMT in ethnic media, but it lacks empirical evidence or practical implementation of the proposed solutions.
- The potential ethical challenges associated with the incorporation of LLM and MMT in news translation procedures are briefly addressed, but a more in-depth analysis of these challenges and their implications is necessary.
- The study emphasizes the transformative potential of LLM and MMT in ethnic media, but it does not thoroughly discuss potential limitations or drawbacks of these technologies, such as biases in machine translations or ethical concerns related to the use of large language models.
