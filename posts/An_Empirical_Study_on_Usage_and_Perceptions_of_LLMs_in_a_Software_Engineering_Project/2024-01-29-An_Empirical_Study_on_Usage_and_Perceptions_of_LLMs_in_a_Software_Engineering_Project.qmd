### **Summary:**
In this study, the usefulness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in an academic software engineering project is explored. The study involved 214 students working in teams, and the findings suggest that LLMs can play a crucial role in the early stages of software development, especially in generating foundational code structures and helping with syntax and error debugging. The study also provides insights into the perceived usefulness, influencing factors, and future outlook of LLMs from a computer science studentâ€™s perspective.

### Major Findings:
1. LLMs can play a crucial role in the early stages of software development, especially in generating foundational code structures and helping with syntax and error debugging.
2. The study revealed that there was a reduction in LLM usage as the project progressed, with LLMs being used more for simpler tasks in the initial stages and for more complex code generation in later stages.
3. There was no significant difference in the correctness and quality of code between teams with heavy LLM usage, teams with light LLM usage, and teams that did not use LLMs at all.

### Analysis and Critique:
The study provides valuable insights into the role of LLMs in software engineering projects and sheds light on the factors influencing their usage. However, the study is subject to limitations, such as incomplete data on LLM usage and prompts used for code generation. Additionally, the study was conducted in an academic setting and may not fully represent the constraints in the software industry. Despite these limitations, the study offers foundational insights into the role of LLMs in software engineering and highlights the need for students to develop skills for effective human-AI collaboration.
