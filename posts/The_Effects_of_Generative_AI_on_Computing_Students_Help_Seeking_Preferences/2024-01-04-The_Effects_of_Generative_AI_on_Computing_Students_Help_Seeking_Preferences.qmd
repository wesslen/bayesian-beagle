## Major Takeaways

- Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, are being adopted by computing students, but have not yet fully replaced traditional help resources.
- Students' help-seeking preferences vary across different tasks, and they often prioritize convenience, iteration, and avoiding social pressures when using generative AI tools.
- The quality of assistance students receive from generative AI tools is dependent on their ability to formulate effective help requests and evaluate the responses.


## Abstract and Introduction

### Abstract
- Help-seeking is essential for computing students, and the emergence of generative AI tools like ChatGPT offers a new on-demand resource.
- This paper investigates computing students' help-seeking preferences and experiences with generative AI tools through surveys and interviews.
- Preliminary evidence suggests that generative AI tools have not fully replaced traditional help resources, and using these tools requires developing the skill of harnessing their capabilities.

### Introduction
- The introduction explores the historical and recent emergence of help-seeking resources for students, focusing on the recent availability of generative AI tools like ChatGPT.
- It sets the context for the study by discussing the potential impact of generative AI tools on students' help-seeking preferences in computing education classes.
- The research questions pertaining to help-seeking resource usage, influencing factors, and comparisons with other resources are introduced.


## Related Work

### Help-Seeking Behaviors and Challenges
- Effective help-seeking is vital for academic success, but students encounter socio-emotional and decision-making barriers when seeking help from peers, instructors, and online resources.
- The barriers guide students' decisions in choosing which help resources to utilize and when to engage with them based on quality and availability.

### Help-Seeking in Computing Education
- Undergraduate computing students face challenges related to learning programming and seeking help, with a focus on troubleshooting, self-directed exploration, and prioritizing online tools over peers and instructors.

### Generative AI in Computing Education
- The potential for using generative AI in computing classrooms is discussed, including its capabilities in providing explanations, enhancing error messages, identifying bugs, and creating instructional materials and programming assignments.


## Methodology

- The methodology section details the participant recruitment process, the survey study, and the interview study conducted to evaluate research questions.
- It provides insights into the design of survey questions and interview questions, along with the analysis methods used for both studies.


## Results

### Frequency of Usage
- Students heavily rely on internet resources for help-seeking, but generative AI tools like ChatGPT are also used, particularly for tasks like debugging and writing code.
- ChatGPT usage varies across tasks, with students utilizing it more for certain tasks.

### Context of Usage
- Students' use of help-seeking resources varies across different tasks, with the internet being the most preferred method overall.
- The experiences with using generative AI tools like ChatGPT for learning new concepts, writing code, debugging, and developing test cases are detailed with quotes from the interviews.

### Factors Influencing Usage
- Trust, trade-offs between convenience and quality, social aspects, and the ability for iteration are explored as factors influencing students' usage of generative AI tools.
- The perceived trade-off between efficient and accurate help, the social dynamics of help-seeking, and the potential for rapid iteration and follow-up questions with generative AI tools are highlighted.


## Discussion

- The discussion provides insights into students' early adoption of generative AI tools for help-seeking and the significant barriers that still exist.
- It emphasizes the importance of students' ability to use generative AI tools effectively and the need for instructors to create pedagogical materials that guide students in maximizing the utility of these tools.
- The limitations of the study and the need for future research with larger and more diverse samples are acknowledged.


## Conclusion

- The study provides critical insights into how students are incorporating generative AI tools into their help-seeking process and the diverse patterns in their utilization and preferences.
- It highlights the potential benefits and challenges associated with using generative AI tools for help-seeking and the need for additional research to understand students' abilities to use these tools effectively.
