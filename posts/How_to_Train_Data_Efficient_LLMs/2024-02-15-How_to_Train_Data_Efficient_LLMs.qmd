### Summary:
The article discusses data-efficient approaches for pre-training large language models (LLMs) and compares data selection routines based on quality and coverage. The Ask-LLM technique leverages zero-shot reasoning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs to assess the quality of training examples, while the Density sampling method models the data distribution to select a diverse sample. The comparison of samplers shows that Ask-LLM and Density are the best methods in their respective categories, with Ask-LLM consistently outperforming full-data training. The article also explores the roles of coverage and quality in LLM pre-training and presents new insights into the tradeoffs between training time, inference cost, data collection effort, and downstream performance.

### Major Findings:
1. Ask-LLM and Density are the best methods for data-efficient pre-training in their respective categories.
2. Coverage sampling can recover the performance of the full data, while Ask-LLM consistently outperforms full-data training.
3. Quality-based data curation yields a Pareto optimal efficiency tradeoff between data quantity and model quality.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article provides valuable insights into data-efficient pre-training methods for LLMs, but it would benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and challenges associated with these techniques.
- The comparison of samplers is comprehensive, but a more in-depth analysis of the tradeoffs between quality and coverage would enhance the article's impact.
- The article could benefit from a discussion of the broader implications of data-efficient LLM pre-training, such as its potential impact on the development of more sustainable and cost-effective training methods for large language models.
