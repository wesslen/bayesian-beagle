**Summary of the Article:**

The article evaluates the potential of ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, for face biometrics tasks such as face verification, soft-biometrics estimation, and explainability. The study explores the performance and robustness of ChatGPT using various public benchmarks and compares the results with state-of-the-art methods in the field. Additionally, the article discusses the setup and configuration of ChatGPT's API parameters, the experiments conducted, and the comparison with other models for specific face biometric tasks. The results indicate that while ChatGPT may not achieve the same level of accuracy as specialized models, it shows promise as an initial assessment tool for face biometrics tasks.

### Major Findings:
1. ChatGPT achieves promising results for face verification and the estimation of soft biometrics attributes such as gender, age, and ethnicity.
2. Performance of ChatGPT varies based on the image quality, pose variations, and domain disparities among comparisons.
3. The model exhibits the capability to provide explanations for its decisions, contributing to better explainability of the results.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the potential application of ChatGPT for face biometrics tasks. However, there are some limitations and concerns that need to be addressed:

1. **Accuracy and Performance Variability:** While ChatGPT shows promising results, its performance varies based on image quality, pose variations, and domain disparities among comparisons. This variability raises concerns about the model's robustness and reliability in different scenarios.

2. **Biases and Inappropriate Content:** The article highlights potential biases in the content generated by ChatGPT, reflecting societal biases present in the training data. This raises ethical concerns regarding the fairness and potential impact of biased outputs on real-world applications.

3. **Cost and Practicality:** The cost associated with using ChatGPT for face biometrics tasks, as well as the limited number of daily requests, may hinder its practical application in real-world scenarios. 

4. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods:** While the article compares ChatGPT with state-of-the-art methods, a more in-depth comparative analysis and discussion of the strengths and limitations of ChatGPT in relation to these methods could enhance the comprehensiveness of the findings.

In conclusion, the article provides valuable insights into the potential of ChatGPT for face biometrics, but further research is needed to address the identified limitations, biases, and practical considerations to ensure the reliable and ethical application of AI technologies in biometric tasks.
