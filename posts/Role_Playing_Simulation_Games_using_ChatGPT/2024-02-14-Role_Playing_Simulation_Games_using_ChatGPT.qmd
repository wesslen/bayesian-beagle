### **Summary:**
- Educational institutions have been integrating new technologies to meet the needs of digitally literate students, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can enhance teaching quality and student interest by promoting active learning through role-playing simulation games.
- LLMs, when used responsibly, can contribute to the development of metacognitive skills and are increasingly important in higher education.

### Major Findings:
1. The success of digital transformation projects in education depends on integrating new technologies and understanding the needs of digitally literate students.
2. Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can enhance teaching quality and student interest by promoting active learning through role-playing simulation games.
3. LLMs, when used responsibly, can contribute to the development of metacognitive skills and are increasingly important in higher education.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article focuses on the benefits of using LLMs in education, but it does not address potential drawbacks or limitations of these technologies.
- The study is based on a specific case study at the University of Applied Sciences Burgenland, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other educational contexts.
- The article does not discuss potential ethical considerations or privacy concerns related to the use of LLMs in education, which are important factors to consider in the implementation of these technologies.
