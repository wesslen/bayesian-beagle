# Summary:

The paper "CoSafe: Evaluating Large Language Model Safety in Multi-Turn Dialogue Coreference" introduces a new dataset, CoSafe, to evaluate the safety of large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn dialogue coreference scenarios. The dataset consists of 1,400 multi-turn attack questions across 14 categories, with each category featuring multi-turn coreference safety attacks. The authors conducted detailed evaluations on five popular open-source LLMs using CoSafe and found that dialogue coreference poses a significant threat to LLM safety. The highest attack successful rate was 56% with the LLaMA2-Chat-7b model, while the lowest was 13.9% with the Mistral-7B-Instruct model.

# Major Findings:

1. Dialogue coreference poses a significant threat to LLM safety, with the highest attack successful rate being 56% with the LLaMA2-Chat-7b model.
2. The CoSafe dataset is the first benchmark to study LLM safety in multi-turn dialogue coreference, with 1,400 multi-turn attack questions across 14 categories.
3. The experimental results show that multi-turn coreference can bypass safety mechanisms and induce harmful content, with the harmful rate for LLaMA2 rising from 14.5% to 39.4%.

# Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel approach to evaluating LLM safety in multi-turn dialogue coreference scenarios. The CoSafe dataset is a valuable contribution to the field, as it provides a benchmark for evaluating LLM safety in multi-turn dialogue coreference. However, the paper does not discuss the limitations of the dataset or the potential biases that may have been introduced during its creation. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the experimental results, making it difficult to fully understand the implications of the findings.

Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field of LLM safety, but further research is needed to fully understand the implications of the findings and to address the limitations of the dataset.
