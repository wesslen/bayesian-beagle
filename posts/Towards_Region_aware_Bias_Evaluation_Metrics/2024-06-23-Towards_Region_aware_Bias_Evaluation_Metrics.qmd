# Summary:

This paper proposes a region-aware bottom-up approach for bias assessment in language models, focusing on gender bias. The authors identify topical differences in gender bias across different regions and use gender-aligned topics to identify gender bias dimensions. The proposed approach is evaluated using a Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT)-based evaluation metric to test for gender biases across different regions in different data domains. The results show that LLMs have a higher alignment to bias pairs for highly-represented regions, highlighting the importance of region-aware bias evaluation metrics.

# Major Findings:

1. The paper introduces a region-aware bottom-up approach for bias assessment, which uses gender-aligned topics to identify gender bias dimensions in the form of topic pairs that capture societal biases.
2. The proposed approach is evaluated using a WEAT-based evaluation metric, which tests for gender biases across different regions in different data domains.
3. The results show that LLMs have a higher alignment to bias pairs for highly-represented regions, emphasizing the importance of region-aware bias evaluation metrics.

# Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel approach to bias assessment in language models, which addresses the limitations of existing methods that rely on assumptions that may not be universally true. The proposed approach is evaluated using a WEAT-based evaluation metric, which provides a quantitative measure of gender biases across different regions. However, the paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed approach, such as the potential biases in the data used to identify gender-aligned topics or the generalizability of the results to other types of biases. Additionally, the paper does not provide a comparison with other bias evaluation metrics, which could help to establish the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of bias assessment in language models, but further research is needed to address its limitations and validate its findings.
