### **Summary:**
In this article, the authors propose a generative framework for multi-modal knowledge retrieval using large language models (LLMs). The framework is designed to effectively retrieve knowledge via a two-step process: generating knowledge clues related to the queries and obtaining the relevant document by searching databases using the knowledge clue. The proposed framework is demonstrated to significantly improve performance across all evaluation metrics when compared to strong baselines.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The proposed generative framework for multi-modal knowledge retrieval demonstrates significant improvements ranging from 3.0% to 14.6% across all evaluation metrics when compared to strong baselines.
2. The Object-aware Prefix Tuning method is essential for fine-tuning the visual backbone and aligning multi-grained visual features into the textual feature space of the LLM.
3. The proposed knowledge-guided generation strategy effectively imposes prior constraints in the decoding steps, promoting the generation of distinctive knowledge clues.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
The proposed generative framework for multi-modal knowledge retrieval shows promising results in improving the effectiveness and training efficiency of existing methods. However, the article lacks a detailed discussion of potential limitations, unanswered questions, or potential biases that may be present in the proposed framework. Additionally, further research is needed to explore the scalability and generalization capabilities of the proposed framework to larger knowledge bases. The article would benefit from a more comprehensive critical analysis of the limitations and future research directions.
