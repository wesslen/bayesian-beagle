### **Summary:**
- Recent developments in computer graphics, hardware, artificial intelligence (AI), and human-computer interaction have led to extended reality (XR) devices and setups becoming more pervasive.
- Large language models (LLMs) can be embedded in virtual avatars or as narratives to facilitate more inclusive experiences through prompt engineering according to user profiles and fine-tuning the LLMs for particular purposes.
- LLMs can enhance diversity, equity, and engagement in XR environments, but may also lead to privacy invasions.

### **Major Findings:**
1. LLMs can be used to create more inclusive and engaging XR experiences through prompt engineering and fine-tuning for specific purposes.
2. The versatile conversational capabilities of LLMs can lead to more engaging XR environments, making XR more pervasive in everyday life.
3. Combining user-provided information with biometric sensor data in LLM-powered environments may lead to novel privacy invasions, necessitating an investigation into user privacy concerns and preferences.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The use of LLMs in XR environments presents promising opportunities for inclusion, diversity, and engagement. However, the potential for privacy invasions and the ethical implications of combining user-provided information with biometric data need to be carefully considered and addressed.
- The rapid advancements in LLM technology and its integration into XR environments may outpace the development of ethical guidelines and privacy-preserving methods, posing a challenge for researchers and developers.
- Longitudinal studies and ongoing assessments of user privacy attitudes and behaviors in LLM-powered XR environments are necessary to ensure that privacy concerns are adequately addressed.
