### **Summary:**
- Transformer-based causal language models have been shown to learn task-specific information by clustering data within its hidden space.
- The clustering process evolves dynamically during learning, aiding the model in handling unseen instances.
- The model's task accuracy remains around zero for the first few epochs before abruptly beginning to rise, indicating the model initially learns task identification through the evolved clustering process.

### Major Findings:
1. The model learns task-specific information by clustering data within its hidden space.
2. The clustering process evolves dynamically during learning, aiding the model in handling unseen instances.
3. The model's task accuracy remains around zero for the first few epochs before abruptly beginning to rise, indicating the model initially learns task identification through the evolved clustering process.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study is limited to a simplified instruction-following task and synthetic datasets, which may not fully extend to realistic settings.
- The findings provide insights into the inductive biases of Transformer-based CLMs for instruction following, but further research is needed to validate the results in more complex and diverse scenarios.
