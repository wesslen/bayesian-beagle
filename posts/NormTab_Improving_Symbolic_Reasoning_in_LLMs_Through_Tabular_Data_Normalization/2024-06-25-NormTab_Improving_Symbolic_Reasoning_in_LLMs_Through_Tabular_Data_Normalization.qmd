### Summary:

The paper introduces NormTab, a novel framework designed to enhance the symbolic reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by normalizing web tables. The study focuses on table normalization as a stand-alone, one-time preprocessing step using LLMs to support symbolic reasoning on tabular data. The authors explore two key research questions: (1) How can LLMs' textual understanding be effectively utilized for data cleaning and transformation tasks, addressing challenges such as structural variance, mixed values, noise, and substring extraction in web tables? (2) How can web table normalization enhance table reasoning tasks, particularly in the context of LLM-based symbolic reasoning?

The proposed solution leverages the advanced textual understanding capabilities of LLMs to independently process and normalize web tables, without relying on specific questions. This approach allows for multiple questions to be asked from a single, normalized table, significantly enhancing reasoning and query capabilities. The normalization process only needs to be performed once, unlike other models that require repeated adjustments based on different questions.

The experimental evaluation conducted on challenging web table datasets such as WikiTableQuestions and TabFact demonstrates the effectiveness of NormTab in improving table reasoning performance. The study aims to demonstrate the importance of web table normalization and its potential to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in handling tabular data for complex reasoning tasks.

### Major Findings:

1. NormTab, a novel framework, is introduced to enhance LLMs' symbolic reasoning on tabular data by normalizing web tables. The framework includes structure normalization (e.g., transposing tables, flattening rows and columns) and value normalization (e.g., removing extraneous strings, standardizing the formatting of dates and numbers) to ensure consistency and accuracy in reasoning tasks.
2. The study demonstrates how LLMs' textual understanding can be effectively utilized for data cleaning and transformation tasks, addressing challenges such as structural variance, mixed values, noise, and substring extraction in web tables.
3. Extensive experimental evaluations using challenging web table datasets, including WikiTableQuestion and TabFact, are conducted to assess the effectiveness of NormTab in improving table reasoning performance, particularly in the context of LLM-based symbolic reasoning tasks.
