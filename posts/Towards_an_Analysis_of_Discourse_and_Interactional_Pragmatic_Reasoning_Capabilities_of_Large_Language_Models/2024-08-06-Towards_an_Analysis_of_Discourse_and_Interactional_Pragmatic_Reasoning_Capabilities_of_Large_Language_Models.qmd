### Summary:
- The article discusses the need for a more precise definition of pragmatic capabilities in research that studies the communicative behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs).
- The authors propose to distinguish between discourse and interactional pragmatic abilities and discuss classification criteria and borderline cases.
- The article provides a summary of which pragmatic phenomena have been tested in LLMs, how they are related to grounding, which methodology has been used, and which models have been considered.

### Major Findings:
1. **Distinction between Discourse and Interactional Pragmatics**: The authors propose a distinction between discourse pragmatics, which focuses on formal reasoning processes, and interactional pragmatics, which addresses conversational reasoning phenomena.
2. **Testing of Pragmatic Phenomena in LLMs**: The article summarizes various studies that have tested discourse pragmatic reasoning capabilities in language models, such as the understanding of conversational implicatures, scalar inferences, and metaphors.
3. **Limited Research on Interactional Pragmatics**: The outcomes appear less promising when examining the study of interactional pragmatics in LLMs, as this field is not as settled and the phenomena are harder to analyze due to their close connection to interaction, spoken language, and spontaneous adaptation.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article provides a comprehensive overview of the pragmatic abilities that have been tested in LLMs so far. However, it also highlights the need for more research in the area of interactional pragmatics, as this field is less settled and the phenomena are harder to analyze.
- The proposed distinction between discourse and interactional pragmatics is a useful framework for categorizing and understanding the pragmatic abilities of LLMs. However, the authors acknowledge that there may be borderline cases and that further research is needed to refine this distinction.
- The article also raises the question of whether certain phenomena, such as Theory of Mind, should be considered part of interactional pragmatics or not. This highlights the need for a more precise definition of pragmatic capabilities in the context of LLMs.
- The article does not discuss the potential implications of these findings for the development and application of LLMs. For example, it would
