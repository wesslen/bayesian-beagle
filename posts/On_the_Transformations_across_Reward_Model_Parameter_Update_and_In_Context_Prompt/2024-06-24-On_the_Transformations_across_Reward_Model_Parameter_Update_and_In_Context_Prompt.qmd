**Summary:**

This paper presents a holistic view of the interchangeability among three popular and distinct adaptation tools for pre-trained large language models (LLMs): parameter updating, reward modeling, and in-context prompting. The authors establish a triangular framework with six transformation directions, each facilitating various applications. The primary contribution of this work is to offer a unified perspective that connects numerous existing studies and outlines potential future research directions.

**Major Findings:**

1. The paper demonstrates the interchangeability of parameter updating, reward modeling, and in-context prompting, forming a triangular framework with six transformation directions.
2. The authors provide a systematic analysis of each transformation, defining their objectives, investigating transformation methods, and reviewing pertinent existing works.
3. The paper spans a substantial breadth of the current frontier in LLM research and establishes insightful connections among diverse prior studies, contributing to advancing the understanding of the current landscape in LLM research.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper offers a comprehensive and unified view of the interchangeability among parameter updating, reward modeling, and in-context prompting in adapting pre-trained LLMs. This framework serves as a useful guide for researchers and practitioners in the field of LLMs, empowering them to make more informed decisions in their research and applications. However, the paper does not address the limitations and unanswered questions that may arise from the proposed framework. Additionally, the authors do not discuss any methodological issues, conflicting evidence, or areas that require further research or clarification.

In conclusion, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of LLMs by offering a unified perspective on the interchangeability of adaptation tools. However, further research is needed to address the limitations and unanswered questions that may arise from the proposed framework.
