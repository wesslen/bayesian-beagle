### **Summary:**
This research idea paper proposes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the productivity of Dafny developers. The authors describe preliminary work on a new Dafny plugin that leverages LLMs to assist developers by generating suggestions for relevant lemmas that Dafny is unable to discover and use. Moreover, for the lemmas that cannot be proved automatically, the plugin also attempts to provide accompanying calculational proofs. The authors also discuss ideas for future work by describing a research agenda on using LLMs to increase the adoption of verification-aware languages in general, by increasing developers' productivity and by reducing the level of expertise required for crafting formal specifications and proving program properties.

### Major Findings:
1. The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the productivity of Dafny developers by generating suggestions for relevant lemmas that Dafny is unable to discover and use.
2. The plugin also attempts to provide accompanying calculational proofs for the lemmas that cannot be proved automatically.
3. The authors discuss a research agenda on using LLMs to increase the adoption of verification-aware languages in general, by increasing developers' productivity and reducing the level of expertise required for crafting formal specifications and proving program properties.

### Analysis and Critique:
The authors' proposal to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the productivity of Dafny developers is innovative and has the potential to address the challenges faced by developers when using verification-aware languages. However, the preliminary experiments with LLMs for lemma and proof inference revealed some challenges, such as syntax errors and the need for meticulously crafted prompts. Additionally, the need for improved LLMs that reduce the need for extensive manual prompt curation was highlighted. The authors also plan to contribute to and extend datasets to ensure the practicality of their ideas. Overall, while the proposal is promising, further research and development are needed to address the challenges identified in the preliminary experiments.
