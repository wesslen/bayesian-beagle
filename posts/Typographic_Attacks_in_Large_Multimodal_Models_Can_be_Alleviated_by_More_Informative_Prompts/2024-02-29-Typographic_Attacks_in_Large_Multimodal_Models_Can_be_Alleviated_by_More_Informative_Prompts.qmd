### **Summary:**

- Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) incorporate pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for various multimodal tasks in the vision and language space.
- Typographic attacks have been identified as a security vulnerability for LMMs, affecting VLMs' understanding of visual content.
- This study investigates the impact of typographic attacks on LMMs, introducing a Typographic Dataset to evaluate distractibility across various multimodal subtasks and typographic factors.
- The research discovers that LMMs can partially distinguish visual contents and typos, and proposes a prompt information enhancement method to mitigate the effects of typography.

### Major Findings:
1. **Typographic Attacks and LMMs:** Typographic attacks disrupt VLMs, affecting LMMs' performance on multimodal tasks. The study introduces a Typographic Dataset to evaluate the distractibility of LMMs.
2. **Typographic Factors' Impact:** The study examines various typographic factors, such as font size, color, opacity, and spatial positioning, and their influence on LMMs' performance.
3. **Mitigating Typographic Attacks:** The research proposes a prompt information enhancement method to improve LMMs' ability to distinguish visual contents and typos, reducing the impact of typographic attacks.

### Analysis and Critique:
- *Limited Dataset Scope:* The Typographic Dataset is derived from specific datasets, which may not cover the full range of potential tasks and scenarios for LMMs.
- *Assumptions on Typographic Attacks:* The study assumes that typographic attacks primarily affect VLMs, without considering potential interactions between VLMs and LLMs in LMMs.
- *Prompt Information Enhancement Method:* The proposed method focuses on improving LMMs' performance by enhancing prompts, which may not address all aspects of typographic attacks' impact on LMMs.

Additional research could be conducted to address these limitations and further explore the impact of typographic attacks on LMMs, considering a wider range of tasks, scenarios, and potential interactions between VLMs and LLMs.
