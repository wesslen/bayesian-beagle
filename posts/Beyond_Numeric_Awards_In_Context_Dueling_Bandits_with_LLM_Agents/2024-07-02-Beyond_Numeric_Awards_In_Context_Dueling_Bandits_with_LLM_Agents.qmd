**Summary:**

This paper investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision-makers in the context of Dueling Bandits (DB). The study compares GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4 Turbo against established DB algorithms. The results reveal that LLMs, particularly GPT-4 Turbo, quickly identify the Condorcet winner, outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of weak regret. However, LLMs struggle to converge even when explicitly prompted to do so and are sensitive to prompt variations. To overcome these issues, the paper introduces an LLM-augmented algorithm, IF-Enhanced LLM, which combines the in-context decision-making capabilities of LLMs and theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms. The proposed algorithm has theoretical guarantees on both weak and strong regret and is robust even with noisy and adversarial prompts.

**Major Findings:**

1. LLMs, particularly GPT-4 Turbo, can quickly identify the Condorcet winner in DB, outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of weak regret.
2. LLMs struggle to converge even when explicitly prompted to do so and are sensitive to prompt variations.
3. The proposed LLM-augmented algorithm, IF-Enhanced LLM, combines the in-context decision-making capabilities of LLMs and theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms.
4. IF-Enhanced LLM has theoretical guarantees on both weak and strong regret and is robust even with noisy and adversarial prompts.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper presents an interesting approach to using LLMs in the context of DB. The findings that LLMs can quickly identify the Condorcet winner are promising, but the lack of convergence and sensitivity to prompt variations are limitations that need to be addressed. The proposed LLM-augmented algorithm, IF-Enhanced LLM, is a step in the right direction, as it combines the strengths of LLMs and classic DB algorithms. However, the robustness of this algorithm to noisy and adversarial prompts needs to be further validated in different scenarios and with different types of LLMs. Additionally,
