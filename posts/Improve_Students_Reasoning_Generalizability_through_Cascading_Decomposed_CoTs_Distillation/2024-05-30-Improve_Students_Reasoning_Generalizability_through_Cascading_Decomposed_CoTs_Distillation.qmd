### Summary:

The paper proposes a new method called Cascading Decomposed CoTs Distillation (CasCoD) to improve the reasoning generalizability of student models. The method decomposes the traditional single-step learning process into two cascaded learning steps, focusing on learning rationales without interference from preset answers. This approach aims to address the issue of widespread spurious correlations between questions and answers, which can limit the diversity and generalizability of the reasoning process.

### Major Findings:

1. CasCoD improves reasoning generalizability by decomposing the traditional single-step learning process into two cascaded learning steps, focusing on learning rationales without interference from preset answers.
2. The method effectively reduces the impact of spurious correlations between questions and answers, improving the reasoning performance of student models on both in-domain (IND) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks.
3. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CasCoD, showing that it outperforms the baselines on both IND and OOD benchmark reasoning datasets.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper provides a well-structured and coherent summary of the proposed method, highlighting its potential to improve the reasoning generalizability of student models.
2. The authors present a clear and concise summary of the major findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of CasCoD through extensive experiments.
3. The paper raises potential problems and shortcomings, such as the impact of spurious correlations between questions and answers, and proposes a solution to address this issue.
4. The paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed method, such as the potential impact of the quality of the teacher model on the performance of the student model.
5. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of CasCoD with other methods that aim to improve the reasoning generalizability of student models.
6. The paper does not discuss the potential impact of the proposed method on the computational cost and training time of the student model.

Overall, the paper provides a well-structured and coherent summary of the proposed method, highlighting its potential to improve the reasoning generalizability of student models. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential impact of the proposed method.
