### Major Findings

1. The paper proposes a joint precoding and alignment matrix design for a multi-user visible light communication (VLC) system assisted with optical reflecting intelligent surface (ORIS) to maximize the average signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) criteria.
2. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed precoding method outperforms zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) precoding algorithms.
3. The study shows that the presence of ORIS leads to higher SINR, and increasing the number of ORIS elements improves the signal strength at the receiver.

### System Model
- Visible light communication (VLC) combines communication with lighting and is an emerging technology for indoor internet access.
- Multi-user MIMO VLC systems utilize an array of transmitting LEDs to support multiple users equipped with photodiodes, with precoding used to mitigate inter-user interference.
- Reflecting intelligent surface (RIS) technology, specifically optical RISs (ORIS), can compensate for path loss and improve the overall signal strength at the receivers.

### Proposed Precoding Method
- The paper presents an optimization problem to jointly design the precoding and alignment matrices, maximizing the SINR under constraints related to the mean alternative current (AC) power of LEDs and the allocated power of all users.
- An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem iteratively optimizing the precoding and alignment matrices.

### Simulation, Results, and Discussion
- Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms ZF and MMSE precoding algorithms in terms of SINR.
- The presence of ORIS leads to higher SINR, and increasing the number of ORIS elements improves signal strength at the receiver.

### Critique
- The paper lacks a detailed comparison with a wide range of existing algorithms and methods, limiting the assessment of the proposed method's superiority.
- The complexity and computational requirements of the proposed method are not fully addressed, potentially hindering practical implementation.
