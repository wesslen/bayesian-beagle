### **Summary:**
- BIDER is a method that refines retrieval documents into Key Supporting Evidence (KSE) through knowledge synthesis, supervised fine-tuning, and preference alignment.
- The approach boosts LLMs' answer quality by 7% while reducing input content length in retrieval documents by 80%, outperforming existing methods.
- The proposed KSE simulation effectively equips LLMs with essential information for accurate question answering.

### **Major Findings:**
1. BIDER refines retrieval documents into KSE through knowledge synthesis, supervised fine-tuning, and preference alignment.
2. The approach boosts LLMs' answer quality by 7% while reducing input content length in retrieval documents by 80%, outperforming existing methods.
3. The proposed KSE simulation effectively equips LLMs with essential information for accurate question answering.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The method performs less effectively in complex datasets like HotpotQA compared with NQ and TQA, suggesting that additional factors need to be considered for complex tasks.
- BIDER requires separate training for each dataset and generator, limiting its use across different tasks and generators.
- The datasets are based solely on Wikipedia, while real-world RAG applications involve diverse sources with varied writing styles, which may require further refinement.
