### Summary:

This paper presents a novel method for utilizing fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to minimize data requirements in load profile analysis, demonstrated through the restoration of missing data in power system load profiles. The authors propose a two-stage fine-tuning strategy to adapt a pre-trained LLM, GPT-3.5, for missing data restoration tasks. Through empirical evaluation, they demonstrate the effectiveness of the fine-tuned model in accurately restoring missing data, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art specifically designed models such as BERT-PIN. Key findings include the importance of prompt engineering and the optimal utilization of fine-tuning samples, highlighting the efficiency of few-shot learning in transferring knowledge from general user cases to specific target users. Furthermore, the proposed approach demonstrates notable cost-effectiveness and time efficiency compared to training models from scratch, making it a practical solution for scenarios with limited data availability and computing resources.

### Major Findings:

1. The fine-tuned LLM, GPT-3.5, achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models in restoring missing data in power system load profiles.
