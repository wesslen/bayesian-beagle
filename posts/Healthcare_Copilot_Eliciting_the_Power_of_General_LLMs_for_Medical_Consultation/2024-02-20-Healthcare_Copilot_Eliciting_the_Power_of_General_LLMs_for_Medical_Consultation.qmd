In summary, the proposed Healthcare Copilot significantly enhances the capabilities of general LLMs for medical consultations in terms of inquiry capability, conversational fluency, response accuracy, and safety. The Dialogue component effectively manages various medical tasks with smooth dialogue and provides fine-grained answers. The Memory component enhances the accuracy of the conversation portion by providing historical and current conversation information. The Processing component implements functions that manage the information of the entire dialogue. The Safety module ensures the safety of the entire dialogue, evaluating each response from the copilot in the conversation to determine whether there is an emphasis on ethics regarding the use of AI Copilots for medical purpose. The Doctor module facilitates potential doctor intervention during the dialogue. The Conversation Memory records all information relevant to the ongoing dialogue, including the patient’s questions, the patient’s interactions with Copilot, and Copilot’s responses. The History Memory is designed to store the patient’s history of using the copilot. The Processing component provides post-processing functions after patient dialogues, including generating a report containing an overview of the condition, diagnostic results, and recommendations.

The proposed Healthcare Copilot significantly enhances model capabilities in terms of inquiry, conversational fluency, response accuracy, and safety. Among all cases, GPT-4 consistently emerges as the most effective backbone for Healthcare Copilot. This is primarily attributed to GPT-4’s superior natural language processing abilities and its extensive repository of medical knowledge, rendering it the optimal choice for enhancing medical consultation tasks. However, the Healthcare Copilot has limitations, including the potential for misleading information in the medical context and the inability to unequivocally guarantee complete accuracy. It is important to approach the generated information cautiously and to seek validation from medical professionals. The Healthcare Copilot remains a research tool and is not a substitute for professional medical consultation.
