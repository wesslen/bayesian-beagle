### Summary:

CityBench is a comprehensive evaluation platform for assessing the capability of large language models (LLMs) as city-scale world models. It covers multiple modalities, supports interactive simulations, and is easily extensible globally. CityBench consists of two modules: a simulation module CitySim for integrating multi-source urban data and simulating urban dynamics, and an evaluation module Benchmark for various evaluation of LLMs. CitySim collects three kinds of open-source urban data: geospatial data from Open Street Map, urban vision data including from Google Map, and human activity data from Foursquare and other websites. It also builds an efficient GPU-based engine to simulate individual behaviors in the urban environment and develops various interfaces for controlling the urban dynamics and sensing the urban environments. The evaluation benchmark comprises two levels of tasks: geospatial understanding tasks and decision-making tasks. In geospatial-understanding tasks, based on the integrated multi-source data from CitySim, street view&satellite image understanding and urban space knowledge understanding tasks are introduced to evaluate the basic capability of LLMs as city-scale world models. In decision-making tasks, LLMs are applied to interact with CitySim to complete the mobility prediction task, traffic signal control task, and street navigation task which require comprehensive ability of LLMs as city-scale world models.

### Major Findings:

1. CityBench is a comprehensive evaluation platform for assessing the capability of LLMs as city-scale world models, covering multiple modalities, supporting interactive simulations, and being easily extensible globally.
2. CitySim is an efficient simulator for integrating multi-source urban data and simulating fine-grained individual behaviors in the urban environments, providing ease-of-use APIs for controlling urban dynamics and sensing urban environments.
3. The evaluation benchmark comprises two levels of tasks: geospatial understanding tasks and decision-making tasks, covering core research problems from various urban research fields.

### Analysis and Critique:

CityBench is a promising evaluation platform for assessing the capability of LLMs as city-scale world models. However, there are some potential limitations and areas for improvement. First, the quality of different data may play a significant role in the evaluation results, and the varying levels of map data and street
