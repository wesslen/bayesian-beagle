### Summary:

* MindSearch is a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework designed to address complex web information-seeking and integration tasks.
* The framework consists of a WebPlanner and WebSearcher, which work together to decompose complex queries and perform hierarchical information retrieval.
* MindSearch models the problem-solving process as an iterative graph construction, enabling effective and sufficient decomposition of complex queries.
* The multi-agent design distributes the cognitive load among specialized agents, facilitating robust handling of complex and lengthy contexts.
* Extensive evaluations on closed-set and open-set QA problems using GPT-4o and InternLM2.5-7B models demonstrated significant advantages in the response quality of MindSearch.

### Major Findings:

1. MindSearch demonstrates significant improvement in response quality, both in terms of depth and breadth, on both closed-set and open-set QA problems.
2. Responses from MindSearch based on InternLM2.5-7B are preferable by humans to ChatGPT-Web (by GPT-4o) and Perplexity.ai applications.
3. MindSearch with open-source models can deliver a competitive solution to the proprietary AI search engine.

### Analysis and Critique:

* The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of MindSearch with other existing frameworks or methods for web information-seeking and integration tasks.
* The paper does not discuss the limitations or potential biases of the proposed framework.
* The paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the framework handles the context state transfer across multiple agents.
* The paper does not discuss the potential impact of the proposed framework on the privacy and security of users' data.
* The paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the framework handles the tradeoff between time efficiency and the exploration of the search space.
