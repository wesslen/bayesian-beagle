### Summary:

This paper presents a comprehensive review of backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs), focusing on fine-tuning methods. The authors classify backdoor attacks into three categories: full-parameter fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and attacks without fine-tuning. The paper also discusses crucial issues for future research on backdoor attacks, such as exploring attack algorithms that do not require fine-tuning or developing more covert attack algorithms.

### Major Findings:

1. Full-parameter fine-tuning: This method involves fine-tuning all the parameters of the model, which can be computationally expensive and may lead to "catastrophic forgetting" of the original task.
2. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning: This method involves fine-tuning only a small number of model parameters, which can be more computationally efficient and less prone to "catastrophic forgetting."
3. Attacks without fine-tuning: This method involves implanting backdoors without fine-tuning the model, which can be more flexible and efficient.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper provides a comprehensive review of backdoor attacks on LLMs, focusing on fine-tuning methods. However, the paper does not discuss the limitations and potential biases of the reviewed studies. Additionally, the paper does not provide a critical analysis of the reviewed studies, which could have helped to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the different backdoor attack methods.

The paper also does not discuss the potential ethical implications of backdoor attacks on LLMs. For instance, backdoor attacks could be used to manipulate the output of LLMs for malicious purposes, such as spreading misinformation or propaganda. Therefore, it is important to consider the ethical implications of backdoor attacks and develop appropriate countermeasures.

In conclusion, this paper provides a valuable contribution to the literature on backdoor attacks on LLMs. However, the paper could have benefited from a more critical analysis of the reviewed studies and a discussion of the ethical implications of backdoor attacks.
