### Summary:
The article proposes a Large Language Model-enhanced Entity Alignment framework (LLMEA) that integrates structural knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with semantic knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance entity alignment. The framework filters candidate alignment entities for a given entity based on structural features of KGs and the internal knowledge of LLMs. Experiments conducted on three public datasets reveal that LLMEA surpasses leading baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### Major Findings:
1. Entity alignment, which is a prerequisite for creating a more comprehensive Knowledge Graph (KG), involves pinpointing equivalent entities across disparate KGs.
2. The proposed LLMEA framework effectively fuses the knowledge from KGs and LLMs and employs the exceptional inference ability of LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance across three datasets.
3. The number of candidate entities significantly influences LLMEA’s performance, as its predictive accuracy correlates closely with the hit rate of the candidate entities.

### Analysis and Critique:
The proposed LLMEA framework demonstrates the potential of harnessing LLMs to enhance entity alignment performance. However, challenges exist in determining the answer from LLMs’ generations, as LLMs may refuse to predict equivalent entities due to privacy and security issues, and may generate unstructured predictions that are difficult to parse alignment predictions. Additionally, the selection of the LLM profoundly affects LLMEA’s performance, as not all existing LLMs are suitable for the entity alignment task. Further research is needed to explore more effective and efficient methods for extracting useful knowledge from LLMs and to address the challenges faced in determining the answer from LLMs’ generations.

Overall, the proposed LLMEA framework represents a significant advancement in entity alignment methodologies, leveraging the strengths of both KGs and LLMs to achieve superior performance. However, further research is needed to address the challenges and limitations identified in the article.
