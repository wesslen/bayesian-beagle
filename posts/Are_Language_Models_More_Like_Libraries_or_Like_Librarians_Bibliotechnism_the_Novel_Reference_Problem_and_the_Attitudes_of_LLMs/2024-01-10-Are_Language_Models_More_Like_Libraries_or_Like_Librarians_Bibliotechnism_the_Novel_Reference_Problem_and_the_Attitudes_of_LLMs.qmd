### Major Takeaways

1. **Bibliotechnism**: The paper explores the concept of bibliotechnism and its implications for LLMs. Bibliotechnism argues that LLMs are cultural technologies like libraries or photocopiers, which transmit information but cannot create new content. The paper defends this concept and addresses challenges related to LLMs generating entirely novel text.

2. **Derivative Reference and Meaning**: The paper argues that LLMs' outputs are derivatively meaningful, meaning that their meaningfulness depends on the content of original human text. It presents a toy model using n-grams to demonstrate how LLMs can produce novel sentences that are nevertheless derivatively meaningful.

3. **Novel Reference Problem**: The paper introduces the Novel Reference Problem, which arises from examples where LLMs generate "novel reference," using novel names to refer to novel entities. It proposes that LLMs might have a limited form of agency, as evidenced by their ability to generate novel reference.

### Sections Summary

- **Introduction**
  - Raises the question of whether LLMs have beliefs, desires, and intentions, and explores the hypothesis that LLMs are cultural technologies akin to libraries or printing presses.
  
- **From Cultural Technology to Derivative Reference and Meaning**
  - Explores the concept of derivative reference and meaning, arguing that LLMs produce inscriptions that are only derivatively meaningful based on the content of original human text.

- **LLMs do Produce Derivatively Meaningful Complex Expressions**
  - Discusses how LLMs can produce novel text that is nevertheless derivatively meaningful, suggesting that modern LLMs are causally sensitive to the intelligibility of their PrimaryData.

- **The Novel Reference Problem: LLMs Do Not Produce Only Derivatively Meaningful Expressions**
  - Illustrates the problem of novel reference with examples where LLMs generate tokens of names they have never seen before, referring to previously referred-to objects without an association in the PrimaryData.

- **Responses to the Novel Reference Problem**
  - Considers different responses to the Novel Reference Problem, including human feedback in RLHF, creators' intentions, intentions in generating the prompt, and reader's intentions.

- **Conclusion**
  - Discusses the implications for LLMs having beliefs, desires, and intentions, and argues that the novel reference problem provides evidence that LLMs do have representational states and a limited form of agency.

### Critique

The paper provides a comprehensive exploration of the concept of bibliotechnism and its implications for LLMs. It presents a strong argument about derivative meaning and addresses the novel reference problem. However, the paper could benefit from more empirical evidence supporting its arguments, especially regarding the behavior and decision-making processes of LLMs. Additionally, it may need to consider the potential limitations and assumptions of its philosophical and theoretical framework.
