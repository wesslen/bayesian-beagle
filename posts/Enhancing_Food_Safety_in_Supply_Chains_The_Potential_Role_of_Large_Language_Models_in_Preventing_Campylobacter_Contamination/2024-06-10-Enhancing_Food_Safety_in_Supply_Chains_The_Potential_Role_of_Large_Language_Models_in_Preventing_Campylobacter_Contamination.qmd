**Summary:**

This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs), specifically generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), to mitigate Campylobacter contamination across four typical stages of the food supply chain: primary production, food processing, distribution and retail, and preparation and consumption. The study also considers critical barriers to implementing GPTs at each step of the supply chain and proposes initial measures to overcome these obstacles.

**Major Findings:**

1. LLMs, such as GPTs, can be integrated into training modules for farm workers to explain the lifecycle and transmission pathways of Campylobacter in poultry farms. They can also simulate interactive scenarios where workers must choose the best practices to prevent contamination at rearing.
2. LLMs can provide customized summaries of HACCP and GHP guidelines that are most relevant to a specific farm's operations. They can emphasize specific control points like chilling during processing, where Campylobacter is most likely to spread, and generate step-by-step checklists for daily, weekly, and monthly hygiene practices tailored to the scale and specific setup of the farm.
3. LLMs can serve as a real-time advisory tool, a conversational "digital poultry advisor," assisting poultry farm workers in making informed decisions when unexpected situations arise. For instance, if a section of a poultry farm reports a sudden increase in temperature or a breakdown in equipment used for processing, the LLM can suggest immediate actions to mitigate any potential increase in Campylobacter risk due to these changes.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The study presents an intriguing potential for LLMs to enhance food safety, but the 'LLM â€“ food safety' interface remains largely underexplored. The proposed applications of LLMs in this domain are promising, but they require further investigation and practical applications. The study also acknowledges that the adoption of LLMs in the food industry and agri-food supply chains may face several inhibiting factors, such as technological adoption, cultural barriers, data quality and availability, and technical challenges in integrating LLMs with existing food processing and slaughterhouse systems.

To alleviate these barriers and enable the deployment of LLMs for bacterial contamination reduction across food supply chains, a
