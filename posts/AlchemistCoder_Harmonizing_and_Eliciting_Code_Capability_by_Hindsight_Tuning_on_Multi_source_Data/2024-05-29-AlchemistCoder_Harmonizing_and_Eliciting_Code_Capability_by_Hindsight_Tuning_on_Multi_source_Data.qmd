### Summary:

The paper presents AlchemistCoder, a series of Code LLMs with enhanced code generation and generalization capabilities fine-tuned on multi-source data. The authors unveil inherent conflicts among the various styles and qualities in multi-source code corpora and introduce data-specific prompts with hindsight relabeling, termed AlchemistPrompts, to harmonize different data sources and instruction-response pairs. The authors also propose incorporating the data construction process into the fine-tuning data as code comprehension tasks, including instruction evolution, data filtering, and code review. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlchemistCoder holds a clear lead among all models of the same size (6.7B/7B) and rivals or even surpasses larger models (15B/33B/70B).

### Major Findings:

1. AlchemistCoder models demonstrate a clear lead among all models of the same size (6.7B/7B) and rival or even surpass larger models (15B/33B/70B) in code generation and generalization capabilities.
2. The use of AlchemistPrompts with hindsight relabeling effectively harmonizes different data sources and instruction-response pairs, improving the performance of Code LLMs.
3. Incorporating the data construction process into the fine-tuning data as code comprehension tasks, including instruction evolution, data filtering, and code review, further enhances the performance of Code LLMs.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel approach to fine-tuning Code LLMs on multi-source data, addressing the limitations of previous methods that relied on single-source data. The use of AlchemistPrompts with hindsight relabeling is a promising approach to harmonizing different data sources and instruction-response pairs, and the incorporation of code comprehension tasks further enhances the performance of Code LLMs. However, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed approach, and further research is needed to evaluate its performance in real-world applications. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the computational cost of the proposed approach, which is an important consideration for practical applications.
