### **Summary:**
The article discusses the data collection procedure used to analyze scientific communication, specifically focusing on detecting LLM-assisted writing. The authors utilized 359 Google Scholar profiles, including scholars from high-ranking, middle-ranking, and low-ranking universities in the United States. They collected and scraped the profiles of the seed scholars, their co-authors, and their co-authors' co-authors, resulting in roughly 120 thousand Google Scholar profiles. After filtering the profiles, they were left with 1096 profiles and 16,928 manuscripts, which were used for the analysis.

### Major Findings:
1. The authors collected and scraped a large dataset of Google Scholar profiles, resulting in 1096 profiles and 16,928 manuscripts for analysis.
2. They utilized a specific filtering process to ensure the quality and relevance of the data used for the analysis.
3. Only the last manuscript of each profile published before 2022 was used for the evaluation of the model, resulting in 1096 manuscripts used for the analysis.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides a comprehensive overview of the data collection procedure used for analyzing scientific communication and detecting LLM-assisted writing. However, it is important to consider potential biases in the data collection process, as the selection of scholars from high-ranking, middle-ranking, and low-ranking universities may introduce certain limitations. Additionally, the filtering process used to select relevant manuscripts may impact the generalizability of the findings. Further research is needed to address these potential limitations and ensure the robustness of the analysis.
