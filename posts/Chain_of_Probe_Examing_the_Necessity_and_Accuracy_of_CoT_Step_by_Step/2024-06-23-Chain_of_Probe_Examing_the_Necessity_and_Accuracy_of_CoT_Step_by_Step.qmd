Summary:

The paper proposes a method called Chain-of-Probe (CoP) to examine the necessity and accuracy of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs). The authors address the issue of early answering, where LLMs already have an answer before generating the CoT, and investigate the underlying causes of this phenomenon. The study reveals that early answering is linked to question difficulty, with models tending to predict answers in advance for simpler questions, making CoT unnecessary for simple tasks. The authors propose the CoP Score to evaluate and select CoTs, aiming for more positive improvements.

Major Findings:

1. The problem of early answering in LLMs is due to the simplicity of the questions, making CoT unnecessary.
2. The change pattern of confidence during the model’s reasoning can be used to examine the correctness of the model’s CoT and answers, thus improving overall accuracy.
3. The CoP Score is proposed to evaluate and select CoTs, achieving accuracy comparable to majority voting.

Analysis and Critique:

The paper provides a novel method, CoP, to detect changes in model thoughts and addresses the issue of early answering in LLMs. However, the study has some limitations. First, CoP currently only applies to multiple-choice questions or questions where the answer is a single token, making it challenging to define the model’s confidence in the final prediction when the target word exceeds one token. Second, regarding the necessity of CoT, it is difficult to determine in advance whether a task is simple, making it impossible to pre-judge whether CoT is needed for a particular question. Lastly, concerning the accuracy of CoT, the CoP Tree has high precision but relatively low recall, leading to an increase in the number of samples needed.

The paper also raises ethical concerns regarding the use of GPT-4 as an evaluator. While the authors prioritize transparency, accountability, and mitigation of potential biases, the limitations of AI should be acknowledged, and it should supplement rather than replace human judgment.

Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the necessity and accuracy of CoT in LLMs and proposes a novel method to address the issue of early answering. However, further research is needed to overcome the limitations and ethical concerns raised in the study.
