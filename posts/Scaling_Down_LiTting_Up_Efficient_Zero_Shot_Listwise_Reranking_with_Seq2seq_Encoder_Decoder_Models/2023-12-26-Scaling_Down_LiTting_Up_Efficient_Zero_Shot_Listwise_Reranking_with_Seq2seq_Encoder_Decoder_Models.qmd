### Major Takeaways
1. The paper introduces LiT5-Distill and LiT5-Score, two methods for efficient zero-shot listwise reranking, leveraging T5 sequence-to-sequence encoder–decoder models, which demonstrate competitive reranking effectiveness compared to recent state-of-the-art LLM rerankers with substantially smaller models.
2. The study challenges the necessity of large-scale models for effective zero-shot reranking, demonstrating that much smaller models can still deliver competitive results.
3. LiT5-Score leverages cross-attention to calculate relevance scores to perform reranking, eliminating the reliance on external passage relevance labels for training, and the study explores the use of sequence-to-sequence encoder–decoder models for listwise reranking.

### Introduction
- Recent work has seen success in listwise reranking using large language models (LLMs) but these methods rely on large LLMs with billions of parameters and limited context sizes, introducing challenges in terms of computational demands.

### Background and Related Work
- The Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) model and RankGPT showed strong zero-shot listwise reranking capabilities and relevance scores are obtained through aggregating attention scores from the FiD model. 
- RankGPT demonstrated strong zero-shot listwise reranking capabilities and the reranking effectiveness of RankGPT could be distilled into smaller pointwise models.

### Methods
- LiT5-Distill leverages the FiD model to perform efficient listwise reranking and LiT5-Score explores the use of cross-attention scores to perform reranking in a zero-shot setting.

### Results
- LiT5-Distill and LiT5-Score demonstrate effective zero-shot reranking capabilities across all model sizes with LiT5-Distill showing notably strong reranking effectiveness.

### Ablation Studies
- LiT5-Distill's reranking effectiveness improves with increased model sizes and the best model variants are determined through ablation studies on training epochs.
- LiT5-ScoreXL performs worse on the MS MARCO collections compared to the smaller models, indicating potential issues with overfitting.

### Conclusion and Future Work
- The paper successfully demonstrates that distilling reranking effectiveness from large GPT models to much smaller models is feasible, and relevance scores calculated from cross-attention are strong measures of passage importance for text generation.

### Critique
The paper presents comprehensive findings on the effectiveness of the proposed LiT5-Distill and LiT5-Score models. However, the study would benefit from more detailed explanations for the observed performance differences in different model sizes and further investigations into potential overfitting issues with LiT5-ScoreXL. Additionally, the paper could have included a discussion on the potential limitations or drawbacks of the proposed methods.
