### **Summary:**
The paper introduces the MouSi model, a poly-visual-expert vision-language model designed to address challenges faced by current large vision-language models (VLMs). The model utilizes ensemble experts to synergize the capabilities of individual visual encoders and explores different positional encoding schemes to alleviate the waste of positional encoding caused by lengthy image feature sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that VLMs with multiple experts exhibit consistently superior performance over isolated visual encoders.

### Major Findings:
1. The use of ensemble experts technique significantly enhances the performance of VLMs by synergizing the capabilities of individual visual encoders.
2. Different positional encoding schemes effectively address the issue of position overflow and length limitations in VLMs.
3. VLMs with multiple experts demonstrate enhanced performance in multimodal tasks, with the triple-expert approach showing the most significant performance improvement.

### Analysis and Critique:
The paper provides valuable insights into the potential of poly-visual-expert VLMs in improving multimodal understanding and performance. However, the study is limited by the size of the training data, and further exploration with larger datasets is recommended. Additionally, the contribution of different experts to the model's output and the necessity of low-contributing experts should be further investigated to optimize the model's architecture and performance. Overall, the paper presents a promising approach to enhancing the capabilities of VLMs through the integration of multiple visual experts.
