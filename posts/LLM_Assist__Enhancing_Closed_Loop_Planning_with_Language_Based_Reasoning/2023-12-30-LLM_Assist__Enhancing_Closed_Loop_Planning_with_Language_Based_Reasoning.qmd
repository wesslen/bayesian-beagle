### Major Takeaways
- The paper proposes LLM-Assist, a novel hybrid planning approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into self-driving vehicle planning to address the limitations of existing learning- and rule-based planners.
- LLM-Assist achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuPlan benchmark, outperforming all existing pure learning- and rule-based methods across most metrics.
- The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of LLM-Assist in navigating complex scenarios and generating well-reasoned outputs, while also remaining grounded through working alongside the rule-based approach.

### Introduction
- Self-driving vehicles face challenges in developing planning algorithms capable of handling unconstrained driving environments despite advances in deep learning and sensing technologies.
- The shortcomings of learning-based and rule-based planners suggest a need for a new approach to leverage the strengths of both methods.

### Method
- LLM-Assist is a hybrid planning approach that leverages a state-of-the-art rule-based planner, PDM-Closed, for common scenarios and a novel LLM-based planner for challenging high-uncertainty scenarios.
- The LLM-assisted planner proposes two modes: one where the LLM directly generates a safe trajectory and another where it provides parameters for the rule-based planner to plan a safe trajectory.

### Results
- LLM-Assist achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuPlan benchmark in both reactive and non-reactive settings, reducing dangerous driving events and demonstrating complex maneuvers in challenging scenarios.
- The paper provides ablation studies highlighting the importance of the base planner, the LLM's control over the emergency brake function, and the impact of LLM temperature on planning performance.

### Critique
The paper presents a novel and promising approach to address the limitations of existing self-driving vehicle planners. However, it would benefit from further exploration of the limitations and potential failures of the LLM-Assist approach. Additionally, the practical implementation, computational overhead, and real-world feasibility of integrating LLMs into self-driving systems should be considered. Further discussion of the paper's limitations and potential ethical concerns related to relying on language models for critical decision-making in autonomous driving is warranted.
