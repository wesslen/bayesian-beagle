### Summary

#### Key Findings
1. **SecFormer Framework**: Introduces the SecFormer framework for privacy-preserving inference (PPI) for large language models that strikes an optimal balance between performance and efficiency.
2. **Performance Improvement**: Outperforms existing approaches in both performance and efficiency, showing improvements of 5.6% to 24.2% for BERTBASE and BERTLARGE models.
3. **Privacy-preserving Algorithms**: Introduces novel privacy-preserving algorithms for GeLU, Softmax, and LayerNorm, and demonstrates their effectiveness through extensive evaluation.

### Introduction
The introduction highlights the escalating privacy concerns with the use of large language models for inference services and the potential risks associated with sensitive data.

### Background
The section introduces the structure of Transformer models and the primitives of Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) and outlines the challenges encountered in Privacy-Preserving Inference (PPI) for Transformer models.

### Method
1. **SecFormer**: Introduces the SecFormer framework, focusing on optimization in model design and SMPC protocol design.
2. **Privacy-preserving Algorithms**: Details algorithms for privacy-preserving GeLU, approximate Softmax, and LayerNorm, emphasizing their effectiveness through ablation studies.

### Experiments
1. **Performance**: Demonstrates performance improvements in SecFormer compared to existing approaches, showing superior performance and efficiency in PPI for BERTBASE and BERTLARGE models.
2. **Ablation Study**: Evaluates the effectiveness of the privacy-preserving algorithms and demonstrates their superiority over existing methods.

### Conclusion
SecFormer offers a promising solution that balances performance and efficiency for privacy-preserving inference in large language models while maintaining high standards of privacy.

### Critique
The paper does not specifically address potential limitations or challenges in real-world deployment of the SecFormer framework. It would be valuable to acknowledge and discuss potential practical challenges or trade-offs associated with implementing the proposed algorithms and frameworks. Additionally, further insights or comparisons with more diverse or complex datasets would enhance the comprehensiveness of the findings.
