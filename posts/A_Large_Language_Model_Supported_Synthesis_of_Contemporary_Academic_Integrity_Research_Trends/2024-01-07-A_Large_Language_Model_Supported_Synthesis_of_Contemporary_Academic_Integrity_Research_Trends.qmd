### **Summary:**
This paper reports on a qualitative content analysis using ChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM), to identify primary research themes in current academic integrity research and the methodologies used to explore these areas. The analysis identified 7 research themes and 13 key areas for exploration, highlighting the influence of technology on contemporary research in the academic integrity field. The findings suggest that while LLM-led research may be an option, there is also a need for continued traditional research. The outcomes underscore the importance of developing policy and operational frameworks for academic integrity to maintain academic standards across modern education settings.

### Major Findings:
1. The analysis identified 7 research themes and 13 key areas for exploration in contemporary academic integrity research.
2. Technology is a guiding force in much of the current research, with a focus on preventing academic misconduct but also potentially limiting the promotion of a culture of academic integrity.
3. The findings suggest a need for continued traditional research alongside LLM-led research in the academic integrity field.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the current landscape of academic integrity research and the influence of technology on the field. However, it is important to note that the use of ChatGPT as the primary tool for analysis may introduce potential biases or limitations. The study's reliance on a single LLM for content analysis raises questions about the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the identified research themes and key areas. Additionally, the article acknowledges the need for continued traditional research, but it does not delve into the potential challenges or limitations of using LLMs for qualitative content analysis. Further research is needed to explore the effectiveness and reliability of LLM-led research in the academic integrity field. Additionally, the article could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the ethical implications of using AI models like ChatGPT for content analysis in academic research.
