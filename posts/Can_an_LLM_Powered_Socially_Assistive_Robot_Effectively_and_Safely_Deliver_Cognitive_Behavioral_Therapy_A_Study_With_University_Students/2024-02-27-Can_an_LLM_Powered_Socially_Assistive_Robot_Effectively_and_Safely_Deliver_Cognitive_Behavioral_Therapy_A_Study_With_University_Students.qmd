### **Summary:**

- The study investigates the effectiveness of a large language model (LLM)-powered socially assistive robot (SAR) in delivering cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to university students.
- The SAR was compared to a chatbot and traditional CBT worksheets in a 15-day study with 38 participants.
- The SAR enabled significant single-session improvements for more sessions than the other two conditions combined.
- Self-reported measures of general psychological distress significantly decreased over the study period in the robot and worksheet conditions but not the chatbot condition.

### **Major Findings:**

1. **SAR-guided LLM-powered CBT may be as effective as traditional worksheet methods in supporting therapeutic progress from the beginning to the end of the study.**
2. **SAR-guided LLM-powered CBT is superior in decreasing user anxiety immediately after completing the CBT exercise.**
3. **The chatbot condition did not show significant improvements in self-reported measures of general psychological distress or pre- to post-session anxiety measures.**

### **Analysis and Critique:**

- The study's strengths include the comparison of the SAR to both a chatbot and traditional CBT worksheets, as well as the measurement of both weekly therapeutic outcomes and pre- to post-session anxiety measures.
- Limitations of the study include the small sample size, the lack of diversity in the participant population, and the short duration of the study.
- Further research is needed to determine the long-term effectiveness of SAR-guided LLM-powered CBT and to explore its potential for addressing a wider range of mental health challenges.
- It would also be beneficial to investigate the potential impact of the SAR's physical embodiment on user engagement and adherence.
- The study raises questions about the potential for LLMs to output potentially damaging messaging, and highlights the importance of following ethical and clinical guidelines in their use.
- The safety measures taken in the study, such as pilot testing and the use of a moderator, are commendable and should be considered best practices in future research using LLMs.
