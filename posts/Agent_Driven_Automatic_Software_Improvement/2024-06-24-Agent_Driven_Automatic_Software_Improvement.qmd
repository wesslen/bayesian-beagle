# Summary:

The research proposal aims to explore the use of LLM-based agents for automatic software improvement. The iterative nature of agents allows for continuous learning and adaptation, which can help surpass common challenges in code generation, such as last-mile problems. The project aims to use iterative feedback to fine-tune the LLMs underlying the agents, making them better aligned to the task of automated software improvement. The main goal is to achieve a leap forward in the field of automatic software improvement by developing new tools and frameworks that can enhance the efficiency and reliability of software development.

# Major Findings:

1. LLM-based agents can perform better than one-shot LLM use in the field of automated software improvement.
2. Multi-agent collaborative systems are able to consistently outperform single-agent systems.
3. The iterative communicative process can be used to fine-tune LLMs.

# Analysis and Critique:

The research proposal presents an innovative approach to automatic software improvement using LLM-based agents. The iterative nature of agents and their ability to learn from each other can potentially overcome the limitations of current LLMs. However, the proposal does not provide a detailed methodology for the development and evaluation of these agents. The research questions and scientific challenges are well-defined, but the research agenda could benefit from a more detailed plan for each phase. The threats to validity are well-identified, but the mitigation strategies could be more specific. Overall, the proposal presents a promising direction for automatic software improvement, but the methodology and evaluation plan need to be more detailed.
