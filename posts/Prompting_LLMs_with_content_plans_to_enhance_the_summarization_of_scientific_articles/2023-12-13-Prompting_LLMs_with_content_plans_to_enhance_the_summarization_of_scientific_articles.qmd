## Summary

### Major Findings
1. **Scientific Summarization Challenge**: Summarizing scientific articles presents unique challenges, given their length, complexity, and irregular organizational structures, making it a remarkably challenging domain within automatic text summarization.
2. **Proposed Prompting Techniques**: The study proposes novel prompting techniques to provide contextual information to aid scientific summarization systems, yielding consistent performance gains, especially for smaller models summarizing sections separately.
3. **Implications and Future Directions**: The study suggests that smaller summarization models benefit from prompts and provides opportunities for further research in exploring different prompt generation techniques and attention mechanisms.

### Introduction
- Automatic text summarization aims to produce shortened versions of documents while retaining relevant information.
- Scientific article summarization is especially challenging due to their length, complexity, and irregular organizational structures.

### Related Work
- Prior work heavily relied on extractive methods but has shifted towards abstractive methods using neural network architectures, motivating the study's focus on enhancing abstractive scientific summarizers based on transformer models.

### Methods
- **Prompting Technique Dimension**: The study compares approaches for generating prompts, providing lists of salient terms through unsupervised extraction from input texts and evaluates five distinct prompting techniques.
- **Model Dimension**: The study integrates prompting techniques with a range of current state-of-the-art transformer models for scientific summarization.
- **Input Text Dimension**: The study explores different text input conditions for summarization, including I+D (concatenation of introduction and discussion texts), S-n/a (summarizing sections separately), and S-w/a (similar to S-n/a, with added section type identifiers).

### Results
- Consistent ROUGE improvements were observed in smaller models, especially when summarizing sections independently, suggesting that supplied terms offer valuable global context.
- Smaller models showed significant declines in quality when exposed to unrelated prompts in confusion testing, indicating active utilization of supplied informative terms.
- No single prompting technique consistently outperformed across all settings, suggesting that the optimal selection depends on specific architectures and tasks.

### Discussion
- The findings indicate that focused local contexts derive the greatest benefit from global information provided through prompts.
- The ETC attention mechanism shows advancements compared to sliding window attention, highlighting the importance of adopting an attention architecture that ensures continuous access to the instruction throughout the summarization process.

### Future Work
- Opportunities for future research include exploring additional prompting techniques, investigating automatic entity prompt generation, and adapting global attention to directly focus on prompt token positions to enhance prompt utilization.

### Conclusion
- The study introduces prompting as a technique to enhance scientific summarization systems and demonstrates particular utility for improving fundamental deficiencies of smaller models in appropriate contexts, providing implications for resource-limited applications.
