### Summary:

This paper introduces a novel context-driven prompting technique for smart contract co-auditing, which employs three techniques for context scoping and augmentation. The approach aims to provide appropriate wording and enough code context based on direct code dependencies to uncover vulnerabilities and provide code audit recommendations. The method demonstrated a detection rate of 96% for vulnerable functions, outperforming the native prompting approach, which detected only 53%. The proposed approach enhances the proficiency of the GPT-4 code interpreter in detecting vulnerabilities, as confirmed by expert auditors from a world-leading smart contract auditing company.

### Major Findings:

1. The context-driven prompting technique for smart contract co-auditing demonstrated a 96% detection rate for vulnerable functions, significantly outperforming the native prompting approach.
2. The proposed approach enhances the proficiency of the GPT-4 code interpreter in detecting vulnerabilities, as confirmed by expert auditors from a world-leading smart contract auditing company.
3. The method employs three techniques for context scoping and augmentation, including code scoping, assessment scoping, and reporting scoping, to provide appropriate wording and enough code context based on direct code dependencies.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a promising approach to improving smart contract co-auditing with the support of GPT-4 code interpreter. The proposed context-driven prompting technique demonstrates a significant improvement in detecting vulnerable functions compared to the native prompting approach. However, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other existing methods for smart contract auditing, which could have strengthened the evaluation of the proposed approach. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations or biases of the proposed method, which could have provided a more comprehensive analysis of the approach. Overall, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of smart contract auditing and highlights the potential of using large language models for this task.
