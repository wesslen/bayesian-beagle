### Summary:
- Influence functions are used to improve the performance of deep neural models by quantifying the perturbation of individual train instances that might impact a test prediction.
- The paper introduces InfFeed, which uses influence functions to compute influential instances for a target instance and adjust the label of the target instance based on its influencer(s) label.
- InfFeed outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin for hate speech classification, stance classification, irony, and sarcasm detection.

### Major Findings:
1. Influence functions can be used as feedback to improve the overall performance of a classification model.
2. Manually re-annotating only those silver annotated data points that have a negative influence can immensely improve the model performance.
3. InfFeed outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for hate speech classification, stance classification, irony, and sarcasm detection.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The paper provides a novel approach to improving model performance using influence functions as feedback, which is a significant contribution to the field of deep learning.
- The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach across multiple subjective tasks, indicating its potential for real-world applications.
- The use of influence functions to reduce annotation costs is a valuable contribution, as it can significantly reduce the need for manual annotation.
- The paper acknowledges the limitations of influence functions, such as the computational intensity, and proposes solutions to address these challenges.
- The ethical considerations and responsible use of sensitive data are commendable, reflecting the authors' commitment to upholding ethical standards in research.
