### Major Takeaways

1. **Sextortion** is a social threat that has emerged with the rapid diffusion of social networks and mobile phones, affecting vulnerable individuals and having far-reaching implications for gender equity, democratic governance, etc.
2. The current state of research on sextortion has focused on understanding the motivations and dynamics of sextortion and exploring potential interventions, but there is a gap in investigating how modern technologies can be used effectively to organize and coordinate prevention and response efforts.
3. This paper aims to develop a system leveraging **blockchain technology** and **artificial intelligence** to prevent sextortion, and it emphasizes the importance of a user-friendly, secure, and efficient system that can quickly address and prevent sextortion incidents.

### Introduction

The introduction provides an overview of the growing issue of sextortion, emphasizing the negative consequences and lack of well-coordinated counseling and support available for victims.

### Presuppositions

- A running case for sextortion is presented, divided into three phases, depicting the dynamics and consequences of sextortion incidents.
- Background literature related to sextortion and the technology-oriented background has also been discussed.

### The Sextortion Governance Goals and Stakeholders

- The section outlines the root value proposition and associated quality goals related to sextortion prevention. It also further refines functional goals and elaborates on the roles and associated emotional goals.

### III-A Root Value Proposition and Associated Quality Goals

- Explains the quality goals related to the root value proposition, including **usability, security, and extensibility**.

### III-B Further Goal-Model Refinements

- Illustrates the refinement of the functional goal prevent sextortion, detailing quality goals such as **flexible, transparent, fast, interoperable, performant, and scalable**.
- Discusses the involvement of the **psychologist role** and associated **positive and negative emotional goals** related to their engagement with the dApp for preventing sextortion.

### IV Conceptual Requirements and System Models

- Details the conceptual requirements and system models based on a novel design methodology for the design of trusted blockchain decentralized applications.

This paper overall presents a valuable initiative in addressing an important social issue using modern technologies. It clearly outlines the system's goals, but lacks discussion on implementation challenges and potential ethical implications of such a system. Furthermore, while it presents a theoretical framework for a solution, practical validation and user testing are necessary to demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness.
