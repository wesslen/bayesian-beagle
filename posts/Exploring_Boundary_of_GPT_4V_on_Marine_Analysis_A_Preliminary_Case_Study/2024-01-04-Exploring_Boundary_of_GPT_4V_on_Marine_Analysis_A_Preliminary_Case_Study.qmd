# Exploring Boundary of GPT-4V on Marine Analysis: A Preliminary Case Study

## Major Takeaways
- The study explores the preliminary case study of utilizing **GPT-4V** for marine analysis, assessing the feasibility of **MLLMs** in domain-specific analysis.
- The experimental results demonstrate that while **GPT-4V** showcases impressive general-purpose visual understanding, it has limitations in fine-grained marine object recognition and advanced marine analysis.
- The paper highlights the potential shortcomings of **GPT-4V** and emphasizes the need for further research and inclusion of more domain-specific training data to improve its performance.

## Introduction
- Large language models (LLMs) like **GPT-4V** have demonstrated powerful abilities in various tasks, but their performance in domain-specific analysis like marine analysis has gained less attention.
- The study investigates whether **GPT-4V** can serve as an effective visual perception system and professional expert for marine analysis, evaluating its performance from different aspects.

## Experiments
### Approach
- The data construction involves samples from private data, internet images, and public datasets to ensure consistency and reliability.
- **GPT-4V's** diverse prompt designs aim to generate comprehensive and descriptive responses aligned with user intents.

### Perception
- The study explores **GPT-4V's** performance in marine object recognition, fine-grained marine object recognition, robustness analysis, and physical world knowledge understanding.
- Results show limitations in fine-grained object recognition and robustness with different image formats.

### Statistics
- Object counting experiments reveal **GPT-4V's** limited ability, especially in crowded or occluded settings.
- The study also assesses **GPT-4V's** capability to recognize all existing objects within visual images, demonstrating more limitations in recognizing all objects.

### Domain-specific Question-Answering
- Evaluation on marine multiple choice questions and domain-specific visual question-answering shows **GPT-4V's** strong optical character recognition but also limitations in handling more advanced marine analysis requirements.
- The study also evaluates **GPT-4V's** support for multi-round conversations and its struggle with marine object recognition.

### Marine Cultural Understanding
- **GPT-4V's** performance in marine logo understanding, artist image understanding, and landmark recognition displays mixed results, highlighting its capability in recognizing certain visual elements but also its limitations.

### Advanced Functions
- The study tests **GPT-4V's** abilities in coral coverage estimation, benthic composition, relationship summarization, event detection, framework understanding, aesthetic evaluation, and temporal sequence understanding.
- **GPT-4V** demonstrated limitations in providing accurate analysis and understanding specific details in these advanced functions.

### Prompt Engineering
- Evaluation of prompt engineering techniques shows limited effectiveness in promoting GPT-4V's visual recognition ability for marine images.

## Discussions and Future Directions
### Discussions
- The study questions the potential roles of **GPT-4V** as an educational or labeling tool and highlights the challenges and potential sample biases in the constructed testing samples.

### Future Works
- The paper emphasizes the need for continued research to enhance the accuracy and expertise of responses generated by **GPT-4V**, emphasizing the inclusion of more domain-specific training data and feedback-driven model improvements.

## Conclusion
- The study concludes that while **GPT-4V** demonstrates valuable findings in visual understanding and reasoning, it falls short of being a strong artificial intelligence domain expert, indicating more research is needed in leveraging multimodal systems for domain-specific analysis.

## Critique
- The study provides comprehensive insights into the performance of **GPT-4V** in marine analysis but may benefit from a more extensive comparison with other MLLMs for a more holistic view of the capabilities in domain-specific analysis.
- The paper could also benefit from addressing potential biases in the evaluation dataset and providing clearer recommendations for future research directions.
