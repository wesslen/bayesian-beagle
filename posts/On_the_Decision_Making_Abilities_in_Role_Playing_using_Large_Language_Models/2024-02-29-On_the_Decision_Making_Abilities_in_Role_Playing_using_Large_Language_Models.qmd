### Summary

- Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for role-playing tasks, with decision-making abilities shaping behavioral patterns.
- This paper evaluates the decision-making abilities of LLMs post role-playing, providing metrics and guidance for enhancing their performance.
- Four aspects of decision-making abilities are analyzed: adaptability, exploration-exploitation trade-off ability, reasoning ability, and safety.
- Results show stable differences in decision-making abilities across distinct roles, indicating that LLMs can effectively impersonate varied roles with genuine sociological characteristics.

### Major Findings

1. **Adaptability**: LLMs can simulate diverse user groups with varying interests over time, reflecting adaptability in user preferences.
2. **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off Ability**: LLMs show varying exploration and exploitation tendencies depending on the role, with type E,
