### Summary:

The paper proposes a novel approach called Hybrid CIR (HyCIR) to improve the performance of Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) by using synthetic labels. The authors introduce a new label synthesis pipeline, SynCir, which generates synthetic labels for CIR using unlabeled images. SynCir consists of three steps: image pair extraction, label generation, and data filter. The proposed hybrid training strategy combines contrastive learning for ZS-CIR with large-scale unlabeled images and contrastive learning with synthetic CIR triplets. The experiments conducted on common CIR benchmarks, CIRR and CIRCO, demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.

### Major Findings:

1. The proposed Hybrid CIR (HyCIR) approach uses synthetic labels to boost the performance of ZS-CIR with a hybrid training strategy.
2. A new pipeline, SynCir, is proposed to generate labels for CIR, which consists of image pair extraction, label generation, and data filter. SynCir can generate diverse labels from unlabeled images, making it easy to scale up to more data.
3. The hybrid training strategy introduced in this work combines contrastive learning for ZS-CIR with large-scale unlabeled images and contrastive learning with synthetic CIR triplets.
4. The proposed solution achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on CIRR test set (R@5: 69.03%) and CIRCO test set (mAP@5: 18.91%).

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a promising approach to improve the performance of ZS-CIR by using synthetic labels. The proposed HyCIR approach and the SynCir pipeline are well-designed and demonstrate significant improvements in the performance of ZS-CIR. However, there are a few potential limitations and areas for improvement:

1. The quality of the synthetic labels generated by SynCir may impact the performance of ZS-CIR. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest using stronger models and enhanced data filter in the data synthesis pipeline to improve the quality of synthetic labels.
2. The proposed approach has only been evaluated on
