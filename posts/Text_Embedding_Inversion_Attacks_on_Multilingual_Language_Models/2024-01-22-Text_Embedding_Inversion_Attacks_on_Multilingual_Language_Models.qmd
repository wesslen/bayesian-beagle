### Summary:

The article presents a comprehensive study on multilingual embedding inversion attacks, focusing on the methodology, evaluation metrics, experiments, and the impact of translationese on test data. The methodology outlines the steps for conducting black-box embedding inversion attacks using a multilingual dataset and ad hoc translation strategy. The evaluation metrics and experiments section discusses the assessment of model performance and the practical implementation of the model. The evaluation of multilingual text reconstruction models demonstrates the performance across languages and datasets, highlighting the vulnerability of multilingual models in certain scenarios. The impact of translationese on test data reveals the potential influence of translationese on the performance of multilingual inversion models in machine translation.

### Major Findings:
1. The multilingual inversion model outperforms or has comparable performance with monolingual models across languages.
2. The vulnerability of multilingual models in certain scenarios suggests the need for further research in multilingual approaches to NLP security.
3. The characteristics of translationese in other languages can affect the performance of multilingual inversion models in English, emphasizing the need for further investigation and consideration of translationese in machine translation evaluation.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the methodology, evaluation metrics, and experimental findings of multilingual embedding inversion attacks. However, potential limitations include the need for further investigation into the impact of translationese on multilingual models and the generalizability of the findings to other language pairs. Additionally, the article could benefit from a discussion of potential biases in the evaluation process and the implications of the findings for real-world applications. Further research is warranted to address these limitations and enhance the understanding of multilingual NLP security.
