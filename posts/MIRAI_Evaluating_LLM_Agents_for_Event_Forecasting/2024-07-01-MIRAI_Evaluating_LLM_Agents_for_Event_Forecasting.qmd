### Summary:
- The paper introduces Mirai, a novel benchmark for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) agents in temporal forecasting of international events.
- Mirai utilizes real-world international event data from the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) and adapts it to an event-forecasting task format across different horizons.
- The framework enables LLMs to interact with both relational and textual databases through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), facilitating autonomous information gathering, processing, and application in a contextually relevant manner.
- The paper evaluates both open and closed sourced LLMs on Mirai with ReAct-Style Agents and "Single Function" and "Code Block" action types.
- The experiments reveal that temporal forecasting tasks are challenging for LLM agents, with the highest-performing GPT-4o agent using the full suite of APIs achieving a 29.6 F1 score in second-level relation prediction tasks.
- The "Code Block" tool-use strategy, which allows more flexible interactions, demands robust code generation capabilities. Notably, GPT-4o is the only model that effectively utilizes and benefits from this strategy.
- The findings emphasize the need for ongoing research into temporal reasoning and the effective use of tools by LLM agents.

### Major Findings:
1. Temporal forecasting tasks are challenging for LLM agents, with the highest-performing GPT-4o agent using the full suite of APIs achieving a 29.6 F1 score in second-level relation prediction tasks.
2. The "Code Block" tool-use strategy, which allows more flexible interactions, demands robust code generation capabilities. Notably, GPT-4o is the only model that effectively utilizes and benefits from this strategy.
3. The findings emphasize the need for ongoing research into temporal reasoning and the effective use of tools by LLM agents.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents for temporal forecasting in the realm of international events.
- The use of real-world international event data from GDELT and the adaptation to an event-forecasting task format across different horizons is a significant contribution.
- The framework's agent
