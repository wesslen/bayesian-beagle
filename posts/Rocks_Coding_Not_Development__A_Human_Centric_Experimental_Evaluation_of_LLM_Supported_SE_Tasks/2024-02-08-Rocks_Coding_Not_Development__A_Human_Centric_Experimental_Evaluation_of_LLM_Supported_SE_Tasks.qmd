### ROCKS CODING, NOT DEVELOPMENT–A HUMAN-CENTRIC, EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF LLM-SUPPORTED SE TASKS

**Summary:**
- The study examines the effectiveness of ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), in performing coding and software development tasks.
- A 2 × 2 between-subject controlled experiment with 109 participants was conducted to compare task outcomes with and without ChatGPT's support in different tasks.
- The findings revealed that while ChatGPT was exhibit certain superiority in helping developers solve coding puzzles, its capabilities in supporting typical development tasks were limited.

**Major Findings:**
1. ChatGPT performed significantly better in helping developers solve coding puzzles, but its capabilities in supporting typical development tasks were limited.
2. Participants' interaction with ChatGPT exhibited rich dynamics, with some viewing it as a colleague and developing complex interactions, while others struggled to work with it.
3. Introducing ChatGPT into developers' workflows did not incur significant changes in their subjective task load, and participants generally held positive attitudes about such tools.

**Analysis and Critique:**
- The study's strengths include its controlled experimental design, large sample size, and focus on real-world developers.
- However, the study's generalizability may be limited, as the tasks were not representative of the entire software development lifecycle, and the participants were all from a mid-size public university in Beijing, China.
- Additionally, the study did not explore the potential impact of different programming languages or development environments on the effectiveness of ChatGPT.
- Further research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and limitations of using LLMs like ChatGPT in software development tasks.
