**Summary:**

The paper introduces PromptWizard, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to iteratively synthesize and refine prompts tailored to specific tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PromptWizard optimizes both prompt instructions and in-context examples, maximizing model performance. The framework refines prompts by mutating instructions, incorporating negative examples, and enhancing both instructions and examples with the aid of a critic. PromptWizard offers computational efficiency, adaptability to varying amounts of training data, and effectiveness with smaller LLMs. Rigorous evaluation across 35 tasks on 8 datasets demonstrates PromptWizard's superiority over existing prompt strategies.

**Key Terms:** PromptWizard, large language models (LLMs), prompt optimization, prompt instructions, in-context examples, computational efficiency, adaptability, smaller LLMs, prompt strategies.
