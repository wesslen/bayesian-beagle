### Summary:

- The authors propose a novel method, SynDARin, for generating and validating QA datasets for low-resource languages.
- The method involves mining parallel English and target language paragraphs, generating synthetic MC question-answer pairs in English, translating them, and validating the quality.
- The authors test the method by creating a QA dataset with K samples for the Armenian language, showing that 80% of the generated English data maintains quality and diversity, while the translation validation pipeline can filter out 20% of data with poor quality.
- The generated dataset is non-trivial and can be used to evaluate reasoning capabilities in low-resource languages.

### Major Findings:

1. The proposed method, SynDARin, allows for the generation of QA datasets for low-resource languages, maintaining content quality and reducing the likelihood of factual errors.
2. The human evaluation of the generated English data shows that 80% of it maintains quality and diversity in question types and topics.
3. The translation validation pipeline can filter out 20% of data with poor quality, ensuring the overall quality of the final QA dataset.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The proposed method has only been tested for a smaller-scale QA dataset creation in Armenian, limiting its applicability to a wider cross-lingual study.
- The study benchmarks should be extended and analyzed further in more multilingual, low-resource languages.
- In the case of extremely rare low-resource languages, the automatic translation part within the pipeline would require either the development of such a translation method, robust cross-lingual transfer from a similar language, or direct manual effort, all of which are bound to introduce either qualitative or logistic complications while creating the final QA resource.
- The authors acknowledge that the proposed methods have currently been tested only for a smaller-scale QA dataset creation in Armenian, thus not allowing them to complete a wider cross-lingual study.
- The study benchmarks should be extended and analyzed further in more multilingual, low-resource languages.
- In the case of extremely rare low-resource languages, the automatic translation part within the pipeline would require either the development of such a translation method, robust cross-lingual transfer from a similar language, or direct manual
