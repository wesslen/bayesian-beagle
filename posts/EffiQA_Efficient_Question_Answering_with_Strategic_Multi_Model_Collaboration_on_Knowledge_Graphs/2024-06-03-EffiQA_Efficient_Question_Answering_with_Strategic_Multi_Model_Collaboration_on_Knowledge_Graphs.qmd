### Summary:

The paper introduces a novel collaborative framework called EffiQA, which aims to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) in complex, multi-step tasks involving knowledge graphs (KGs). Existing approaches either underutilize the reasoning abilities of LLMs or suffer from high computational costs due to tight coupling. EffiQA addresses these limitations by employing an iterative paradigm consisting of three stages: global planning, efficient KG exploration, and self-reflection. In the global planning stage, LLMs leverage their commonsense capabilities to explore potential reasoning pathways. Then, a small plug-in model is used for efficient KG exploration through semantic pruning. Finally, the exploration results are fed back to the LLMs for self-reflection to improve global planning and KG exploration. Empirical evidence on multiple KBQA benchmarks shows EffiQA's effectiveness in achieving an optimal balance between reasoning accuracy and computational costs.

### Major Findings:

1. EffiQA employs an iterative paradigm consisting of global planning, efficient KG exploration, and self-reflection to strike a balance between performance and efficiency.
2. In the global planning stage, LLMs leverage their commonsense capabilities to explore potential reasoning pathways, while a small plug-in model is used for efficient KG exploration through semantic pruning.
3. The exploration results are fed back to the LLMs for self-reflection to improve global planning and KG exploration, leading to improved performance.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches that either underutilize the reasoning abilities of LLMs or suffer from high computational costs due to tight coupling.
2. The proposed EffiQA framework demonstrates promising results in achieving an optimal balance between reasoning accuracy and computational costs.
3. However, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods or discuss the potential limitations and challenges of the proposed approach.
4. Further research is needed to evaluate the performance of EffiQA in real-world scenarios and compare it with other existing methods.
5. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of the computational costs and potential trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.
