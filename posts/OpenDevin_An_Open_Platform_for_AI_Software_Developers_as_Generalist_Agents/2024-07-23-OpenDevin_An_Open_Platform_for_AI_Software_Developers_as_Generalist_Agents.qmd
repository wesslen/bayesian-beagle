**Summary:**

OpenDevin is an open platform designed for AI software developers, offering a powerful and flexible environment for the development of AI agents that interact with the world through software. The platform supports the implementation of new agents, safe interaction with sandboxed environments for code execution, coordination between multiple agents, and incorporation of evaluation benchmarks. The architecture of OpenDevin includes an interaction mechanism, an environment consisting of a sandboxed operating system and a web browser, and an interface for agents to create complex software, execute code, and browse websites. The platform also supports multi-agent delegation and an evaluation framework for assessing agents across various tasks.
