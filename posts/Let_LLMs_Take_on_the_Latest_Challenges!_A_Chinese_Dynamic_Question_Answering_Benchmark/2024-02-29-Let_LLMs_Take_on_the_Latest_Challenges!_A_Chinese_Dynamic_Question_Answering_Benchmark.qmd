### Summary

- The article introduces CDQA, a Chinese Dynamic QA benchmark, to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer dynamic questions related to the latest news on the Chinese Internet.
- The dataset is constructed using a semi-automatic pipeline that combines human and model efforts, and is classified by the frequency of answer changes.
- Mainstream and advanced Chinese LLMs have been evaluated on CDQA, revealing that the benchmark is challenging and worthy of further study.

### Major Findings
1. **CDQA Benchmark:** The article presents CDQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering dynamic questions related to the latest Chinese news.
2. **Semi-automatic Data Collection:** The dataset is constructed using a semi-automatic pipeline, combining human and model efforts to ensure high-quality data.
3. **Frequency-based Classification:** The samples in the dataset are carefully classified according to the frequency of answer changes, allowing for a more fine-grained observation of LLMs' capabilities.

### Analysis and Critique
- *Limited Scope:* The article focuses on the Chinese language and Internet news, which may not be representative of other languages or contexts.
- *Lack of Comparison with English Benchmarks:* The article could benefit from comparing its findings with existing English benchmarks, such as FreshQA, to highlight similarities and differences.
- *Potential for Bias:* The dataset may contain biases due to the sources of the news articles and the selection of question-answer pairs. It is essential to address these biases in future research.
