### Summary:
- Personalization in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly important, aiming to align LLM’s interactions, content, and recommendations with individual user preferences.
- Recent advances in LLM personalization have spotlighted effective prompt design, by enriching user queries with non-parametric knowledge through behavior history retrieval and textual profiles.
- To address these shortcomings, we introduce One PEFT Per User (OPPU)111The code is available at https://github.com/TamSiuhin/OPPU, which employs personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules, to store user-specific behavior patterns and preferences.

### Major Findings:
1. OPPU significantly outperforms existing prompt-based methods across seven diverse tasks in the LaMP benchmark.
2. OPPU's enhanced capabilities in handling user behavior shifts, modeling users at different active levels, maintaining robustness across various user history formats, and displaying versatility with different PEFT methods.
3. OPPU's pioneering approach to PEFT-based LLM personalization ensures LLM ownership and significantly improves the model’s ability to adapt to shifts in user behavior.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article does not address the potential ethical concerns related to privacy, data bias, and accessibility in LLM personalization.
- The limitations of OPPU are identified, including the focus on one specific task per user and the potential biases in user interests.
- The efficiency analysis of OPPU demonstrates the linear growth of training time with the increase in average tokens per history entry.
