### Summary:

The study investigates the impact of code modularity on the performance of large language models (LLMs) for natural language to code (NL2Code) generation. Unlike conventional wisdom, the authors find that modularity is not a core factor for improving the performance of code generation models. The authors introduce a novel metric, called MoS, for quantifying the modularity of code snippets and evaluate its impact on performance. The results reveal no significant correlation, or even a possible weak negative correlation, between modularity and performance. This suggests that factors influencing the usefulness of code examples may differ between human and LLM perspectives.

### Major Findings:

1. The authors introduce a novel metric, called MoS, for quantifying the modularity of code snippets.
2. The study reveals no significant correlation, or even a possible weak negative correlation, between modularity and performance.
3. The results suggest that factors influencing the usefulness of code examples may differ between human and LLM perspectives.

### Analysis and Critique:

The study provides valuable insights into the impact of code modularity on the performance of LLMs for NL2Code generation. However, the study has some limitations. Due to limited computational resources, the authors focused on designing experimental settings that are both targeted and generalizable. This restricted the scope of their investigation. Considering more extensive configurations in future work—such as fine-tuning, employing much larger models, and evaluating other programming languages—will help validate and potentially broaden the applicability of their findings. Despite these limitations, the study offers valuable insights and identifies a core factor besides modularity that directly affects performance.
