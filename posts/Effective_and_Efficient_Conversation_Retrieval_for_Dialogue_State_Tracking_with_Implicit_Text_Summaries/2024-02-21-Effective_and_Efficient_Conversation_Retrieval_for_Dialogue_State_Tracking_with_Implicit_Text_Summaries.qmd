### **Summary:**
- Few-shot dialogue state tracking (DST) with Large Language Models (LLM) relies on an effective and efficient conversation retriever to find similar in-context examples for prompt learning.
- The approach of using raw dialogue context as search keys and queries is less suited for scaling to new domains or new annotation languages.
- To address this problem, the authors handle the task of conversation retrieval based on text summaries of the conversations.

### **Major Findings:**
1. Dialogue state tracking (DST) is crucial in task-oriented dialogue systems, and recent works have adopted in-context learning with pre-trained large language models (LLM) for few-shot DST.
2. The proposed conversation retrieval approach using text summaries as search keys and queries significantly improves the performance of few-shot DST compared to previous methods.
3. The introduction of a light-weight conversation encoder, CONVERSE, further enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the conversation retrieval approach.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The proposed approach significantly improves the efficiency and performance of few-shot DST, but there are limitations in the quality of the conversation summaries generated by the LLM.
- The reliance on the quality of the conversation summaries may introduce errors in the retrieval process, and further improvements in the summarization task are necessary.
- The study demonstrates the potential of the proposed conversation retrieval approach, but additional research is needed to address the limitations and enhance the overall effectiveness of the method.
