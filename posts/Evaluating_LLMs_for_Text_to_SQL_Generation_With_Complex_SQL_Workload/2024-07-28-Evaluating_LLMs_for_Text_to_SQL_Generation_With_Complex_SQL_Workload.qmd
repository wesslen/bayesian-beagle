### Summary:

This study presents a comparative analysis of the TPC-DS benchmark with the BIRD and Spider benchmarks for text-to-SQL generation. The findings reveal that TPC-DS queries exhibit a significantly higher level of structural complexity compared to the other two benchmarks. This underscores the need for more intricate benchmarks to simulate realistic scenarios effectively. The study utilized 11 distinct Language Models (LLMs) to generate SQL queries based on the query descriptions provided by the TPC-DS benchmark. The results demonstrated that the current state-of-the-art generative AI models fall short in generating accurate decision-making queries.

### Major Findings:

1. TPC-DS queries exhibit a significantly higher level of structural complexity compared to the BIRD and Spider benchmarks.
2. The current state-of-the-art generative AI models fall short in generating accurate decision-making queries.
3. The accuracy of the generated queries is insufficient for practical real-world application.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The study does not provide a detailed analysis of the specific areas where the LLMs fail to generate accurate queries.
- The study does not discuss the potential reasons for the poor performance of the LLMs, such as the complexity of the SQL queries or the limitations of the LLMs.
- The study does not provide any recommendations for improving the performance of the LLMs for text-to-SQL generation.
- The study does not discuss the potential implications of the findings for the development of more sophisticated text-to-SQL benchmarks.
- The study does not discuss the potential applications of the findings for the development of more accurate and efficient text-to-SQL systems.
