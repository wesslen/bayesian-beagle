### **Summary:**
- The rise of multimodal misinformation on social platforms poses significant challenges for individuals and societies.
- Large Vision Language Models (LVLM) offer a potential solution to this problem by leveraging their proficiency in processing visual and textual information.
- LVLM demonstrates promising capabilities in recognizing complex information and exhibiting strong reasoning skills.
- The proposed LEMMA framework leverages LVLM intuition and reasoning capabilities while augmenting them with external knowledge to enhance the accuracy of misinformation detection.

### **Major Findings:**
1. LVLM has superior performance compared to LLMs, but its profound reasoning may present limited power with a lack of evidence.
2. LEMMA improves the accuracy over the top baseline LVLM by 7% and 13% on Twitter and Fakeddit datasets, respectively.
3. LEMMA effectively combines the intuitive and reasoning strengths of LVLM while addressing their factual grounding limitations.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- LEMMA significantly enhances accuracy compared to the top baseline LVLM, with improvements of 7% and 13% on the Twitter and Fakeddit datasets, respectively.
- An ablation study showed that bypassing LVLMâ€™s self-evaluation of external evidence necessity led to a decrease in accuracy, suggesting the importance of LVLM's self-evaluation.
- LEMMA exhibits robust performance across different datasets, confirming its reliability and effectiveness in diverse contexts.
- LEMMA accurately replicates over 98% of Direct (GPT-4V) correct predictions in Fakeddit, while in Twitter, this figure stands at over 96%, demonstrating its consistency and reliability.
- The proposed LEMMA framework consistently surpasses baseline models on the Twitter and Fakeddit datasets in terms of both Accuracy and F1 Score, demonstrating its effectiveness in minimizing both false positives and false negatives.
