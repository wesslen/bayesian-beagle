# Bayesian beagle blog 🐶

Welcome to the Bayesian beagle blog! This project is a unique intersection of machine learning and scientific communication, providing a platform where readers can quickly get insights from the latest research papers hosted on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/). Utilizing state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), our system generates concise, comprehensible summaries of complex research articles, covering a wide array of disciplines.

Our blog is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system designed for creating beautiful, data-driven content. It is then published with [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).

## Features

- **Curated ArXiv Articles**: A handpicked selection of the most intriguing and high-impact research papers from various fields on ArXiv.
- **Automated Summaries**: Each article is accompanied by a summary automatically generated by a sophisticated Large Language Model tailored for scientific content, utilizing Arxiv's new [HTML (beta) formatting](https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessible_HTML.html).
- **Regular Updates**: Our collection is updated regularly via GitHub actions to include new research findings and innovations.
- **LLM-research**: Coverage focuses on LLM-related research.

## How It Works

1. **Article Selection**: We curate a list of ArXiv articles based on recency, impact, and relevance to a diverse audience.
2. **Summary Generation**: LLMs are employed to read and understand the selected articles and provide a human-readable summary.
3. **Blog Publication**: These summaries are formatted and published as blog posts on our Quarto-powered platform.
