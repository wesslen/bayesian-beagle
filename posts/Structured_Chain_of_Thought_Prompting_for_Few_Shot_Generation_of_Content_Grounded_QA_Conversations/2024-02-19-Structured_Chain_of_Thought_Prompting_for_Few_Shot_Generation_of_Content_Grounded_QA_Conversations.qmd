### Summary:
- The article introduces a structured chain-of-thought (SCoT) prompting approach to generating content-grounded multi-turn question-answer conversations using a pre-trained large language model (LLM).
- The proposal is based on a structured breakdown of the complex task into a number of states in a state machine, allowing for actions corresponding to various subtasks to be executed in their own dedicated states.
- The experimental results show that SCoT prompting
