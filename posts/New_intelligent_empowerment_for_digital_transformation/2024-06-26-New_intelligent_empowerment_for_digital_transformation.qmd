**Summary:**

This study proposes a novel evaluation method for measuring the digital transformation (DT) process of enterprises based on large language models (LLMs). The authors analyzed annual reports of 4407 companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq from 2005 to 2022, constructing a comprehensive set of DT indicators. The findings reveal that DT significantly improves a company's financial performance, but different digital technologies have varying effects on financial performance. Specifically, blockchain technology has a relatively limited positive impact on financial performance. Additionally, DT can promote the growth of financial performance by enhancing operational efficiency and reducing costs.

**Major Findings:**

1. DT significantly improves a company's financial performance, as measured by asset return rate (ROA) and equity return rate (ROE).
2. Different digital technologies have varying effects on financial performance. While big data (BD), artificial intelligence (AI), mobile internet (MI), cloud computing (CC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) significantly improve ROA and ROE, blockchain technology does not demonstrate a significant positive impact on ROA and ROE.
3. The effects of DT on financial performance vary among different financial performance enterprises. For enterprises with poor financial performance, DT can effectively enhance their ROA and ROE. However, for enterprises with good financial performance or especially outstanding performance, the impact of DT on ROA and ROE is not significant.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The study provides a novel DT evaluation tool for the academic community and expands the application scope of generative artificial intelligence technology in economic research. However, several limitations and potential biases should be considered:

1. The study focuses on a specific set of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, which may not be representative of all industries or regions.
2. The analysis relies on annual reports, which may not capture the full extent of a company's DT efforts or the nuances of their implementation.
3. The study does not account for potential confounding factors, such as industry-specific trends or macroeconomic conditions, that may influence the relationship between DT and financial performance.
4. The study does not explore the potential long-term effects of DT on financial performance or the sustainability of these improvements.
