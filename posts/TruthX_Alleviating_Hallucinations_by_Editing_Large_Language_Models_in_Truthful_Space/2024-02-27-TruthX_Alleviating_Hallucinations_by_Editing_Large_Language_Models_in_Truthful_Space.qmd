### **Summary:**
- Large Language Models (LLMs) sometimes produce hallucinations, generating untruthful responses despite possessing correct knowledge.
- TruthX is proposed as a method to elicit the truthfulness of LLMs by editing their internal representations in truthful space.
- Experiments show that TruthX effectively improves the truthfulness of 13 advanced LLMs by an average of 20% on the TruthfulQA benchmark.

### **Major Findings:**
1. TruthX enhances the truthfulness of LLMs by editing their internal representations in truthful space.
2. TruthX exhibits superiority in truthfulness control, showing significant improvements in truthfulness across various LLMs.
3. The truthful space acquired by TruthX plays a pivotal role in controlling LLMs to produce truthful or hallucinatory responses.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- TruthX demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing the truthfulness of LLMs, but it does not guarantee consistent generation of truthful responses.
- The method's limitations include the inability to create new knowledge beyond the scope of LLM training and the need for collaboration with external knowledge for comprehensive truthfulness enhancement.
- The proposed method shows promise in mitigating hallucinations of LLMs, but further research is needed to address its limitations and potential biases.
