**Summary:**

The paper proposes a novel channel prediction method called LLM4CP, which is based on fine-tuning pre-trained GPT-2 for MISO-OFDM channel prediction tasks. The method predicts future downlink CSI sequences based on historical uplink CSI sequences and can be applied to both TDD and FDD systems. To account for channel characteristics, the authors have tailored preprocessor, embedding, and output modules to bridge the gap between CSI data and LLM. Preliminary simulations validate the superiority of LLM4CP over existing model-based and deep learning-based channel prediction methods in full-sample, few-shot, and generalization tests with acceptable training and inference costs.

**Major Findings:**

1. The proposed LLM4CP method outperforms existing model-based and deep learning-based channel prediction methods in full-sample, few-shot, and generalization tests.
2. The method can be applied to both TDD and FDD systems and has acceptable training and inference costs.
3. The tailored preprocessor, embedding, and output modules help bridge the gap between CSI data and LLM, enabling the transfer of knowledge across models from the pre-trained LLM.

**Analysis and Critique:**

1. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of LLM4CP with other state-of-the-art channel prediction methods, which could help to better understand its advantages and limitations.
2. The paper does not discuss the potential impact of the proposed method on the overall system performance, such as the achievable rate or the bit error rate.
3. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, which is an important factor for practical implementation.
4. The paper does not discuss the potential impact of the proposed method on the design of the transceiver, which is an important aspect of the overall system design.
5. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the generalization performance of the proposed method, which is an important factor for practical implementation.

Overall, the paper presents an interesting and promising approach to channel prediction based on fine-tuning pre-trained GPT-2. However, more detailed analysis and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods are needed to better understand its advantages and
