### Summary:

The article introduces PDSS, a privacy-preserving framework for step-by-step distillation of large language models (LLMs). PDSS addresses the challenges of domain-specific knowledge privacy and resource constraints in real-world applications. The framework operates on a server-client architecture, where the client transmits perturbed prompts to the server's LLM for rationale generation. The generated rationales are then decoded by the client and used to enrich the training of task-specific small language models (SLMs) within a multi-task learning paradigm.

PDSS introduces two privacy protection strategies: the Exponential Mechanism Strategy and the Encoder-Decoder Strategy. The Exponential Mechanism Strategy utilizes an exponential mechanism to obfuscate user prompts, while the Encoder-Decoder Strategy employs a specialized Encoder-Decoder SLM to encode and decode perturbed prompts and rationales. These strategies effectively balance user privacy and the usability of rationales, allowing for secure and enhanced training of the client's SLM without compromising privacy concerns.

Experiments on various text generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of PDSS in training task-specific SLMs with enhanced performance. By harnessing the rationales generated by the server-side LLM, PDSS provides valuable task-specific knowledge to the SLM, enabling them to achieve significant improvements with the support of the LLM while prioritizing data privacy protections.
