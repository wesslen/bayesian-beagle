### Semantic Importance-Aware Based for Multi-User Communication Over MIMO Fading Channels

#### **Major Takeaways:**
1. **Semantic communication** represents a promising next-generation communication paradigm and is characterized by considering the representation of **semantic information** in the source and the impact of the channel on the semantics.
2. The paper presents a **semantic importance-aware** based communication system (SIA-SC) over MIMO Rayleigh fading channels, which aims to maximize the end-to-end semantic performance through a new **layer mapping method** and addresses **multi-user** 
scenarios through a method of semantic interference cancellation.
3. The introduction of a new metric, **semantic information distortion (SID)**, enables the authors to derive performance expressions and **Semantic Outage Probability (SOP)** for various scenarios. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant improvements in semantic performance.

### I Introduction
- Semantic communication is a promising paradigm that considers the representation of semantic information in the source and the impact of the channel on the semantics.
- Previous work has focused on the inequality of semantic symbols to achieve variable length coding schemes for semantic communications.

### II System Model
#### II-A The framework of SIA-SC
- The SIA-SC system integrates semantic symbols' inequality with the characteristics of MIMO channels through a layer mapping method.
#### II-B The framework of O-MDMA-based SIA-SC for multi-users
- The system extends to multi-user transmission scenarios using the Orthogonal Model Division Multiple Access (O-MDMA) technology.

### III Semantic System Analysis
#### III-A Semantic Information Distortion and Semantic Outage Probability
- A new metric, semantic information distortion (SID), is introduced to represent the impact of SNR and CBR on semantic performance.
#### III-B SU-MIMO scenarios, III-C MU-SISO scenarios, III-D MU-MIMO scenarios
- The performance of the SIA-SC system is analyzed in Single-User MIMO (SU-MIMO), Multi-Users SISO (MU-SISO), and Multi-Users MIMO (MU-MIMO) scenarios.

### IV Experiments and Discussions
#### IV-A Experimental Setup
- The SIA-SC system is trained and tested on the Open Images dataset, and experiments include comparisons with baseline schemes using JPEG, JPEG2000, and BPG for image compression.
#### IV-B Single-user and IV-C Multi-user Transmission Performance
- The SIA-SC system outperforms baseline schemes in both single-user and multi-user scenarios.
#### IV-D Validation of Semantic System Analysis
- The theoretical results are validated through simulations, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed performance and outage probability metrics.
#### V Conclusion
- The paper presents the advantages of the SIA-SC system in improving semantic performance over MIMO fading channels, with potential applications in multi-user and single-user scenarios.

### Critique
- The paper could benefit from clearer explanations and more concise mathematical derivations to enhance readability. The use of visual aids and diagrams greatly aids in understanding the proposed system and its performance.
