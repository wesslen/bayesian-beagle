Two dedicated evaluation tasks are proposed: version-specific code completion (VSCC) and version-aware code editing (VACE). Comprehensive experiments are conducted to benchmark the performance of LLMs, revealing the challenging nature of these tasks and the struggle of even state-of-the-art LLMs to generate version-correct code.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1.

The study uses a synthetic dataset with seven representative OCKR tasks to evaluate the LLaMA2-13B-chat model. The results show that the model's proficiency in OCKR is limited, regardless of whether the knowledge is trained in separate or adjacent settings. Training the model to reason with complete reasoning data did not result in significant improvement. However, training the model to perform explicit knowledge retrieval helped in only one of the tasks, indicating that the model's limited OCKR capabilities are due to difficulties in retrieving relevant knowledge. The study also evaluates the model's ability to transfer knowledge across languages and finds that it exhibits limited ability in this area as well.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The LLaMA2-13B-chat model shows limited OCKR ability, even with knowledge occurring adjacently during training.\n2. Training the model with reasoning examples does not lead to significant improvement, suggesting that enhancing reasoning ability in general is insufficient for effective OCKR.\n3. With the help of CoT, the model achieves over 90% accuracy in one task but does not surpass the random level in other two tasks. This indicates that the model can effectively retrieve attribute knowledge but struggles with correctly retrieving relational knowledge, which might be a limiting factor in OCKR.\n4. In both the Separate and Adjacent settings, the performance in cross-lingual scenarios surpasses that of the monolingual, but the overall performance is still weak.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the OCKR capabilities of LLMs, highlighting their limitations in this area. However, the study is limited to a few selected models, with the largest model being only 13B parameters. This limitation prevents the assessment of the capabilities of more advanced models, such as GPT-4.

The models are tasked with assigning relevance scores to each pair, which are then compared to those from human annotators to evaluate inter-annotator agreement levels. The results reveal that LLMs can be used in low-resource language scenarios to automate relevance judgment tasks, with an inter-annotator agreement of Cohen\u2019s kappa score of 0.2634 when evaluated using the 70B variant of the LLaMA3 model.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1.

The method is evaluated using the real-world closed-loop motion planning nuPlan benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the LLM planner in a real-world setting.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. InstructDriver aligns LLMs with human driving behavior by generating a series of instructions based on human driving logic.\n2.

Fine-tuned DARA achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with both ICL-based and other fine-tuned agents (AgentLMs and fine-tuned AgentBench) across the three important benchmarks in zero-shot evaluation. Moreover, training with 768 reasoning trajectories, DARA can achieve highly competitive performances comparable to enumerating-and-ranking-based models trained on larger data.\n3. The ongoing challenge of generating high-quality reasoning trajectories for language agents in KGQA with GPT-4 has been revealed.

{"id": "2406.06870v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe article discusses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) and suggests integrating them with an \"algebraic\" representation of knowledge, including symbolic AI elements used in expert systems, to create Large Knowledge Models (LKMs). This integration aims to create models that not only possess \"deep\" knowledge grounded in first principles but also have the ability to reason and explain, mimicking human expert capabilities.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. LLMs, such as GPT-3.5, use high-dimensional vectors for embedding tokens, which raises the question of whether they use a \"geometric\" representation rather than an \"algebraic\" one for their knowledge internally.\n2. The performance of LLMs critically depends on the quantity and quality of data used in their training. As the LLM has more parameters and is trained on more data, its problem-solving capability grows enormously.\n3. Recent research from Anthropic AI and Open AI reveals that LLMs, such as Claude 3 Sonnet, use a \"geometry\"-like internal representation in a high-dimensional embedding space rather than an \"algebraic\" one. This representation captures the meanings of words and phrases and their relative distances, making it easier to do sophisticated \"reasoning,\" such as analogies and metaphors.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n1. The article suggests that relying only on a \"geometric\" understanding of the world limits the potential of LLMs, particularly for science and engineering applications.\n2. The authors argue that current LLMs have achieved animal-like mastery of their tasks but not a \"deeper\" mechanistic understanding of the world, as humans do.\n3. The article highlights the need for LLMs to evolve beyond their current capabilities and incorporate both \"algebraic\" (i.e., symbolic) and \"geometric\" representations of the world, particularly for science and engineering.\n4. The authors propose the development of hybrid AI systems, called Large Knowledge Models (LKMs), which would not be limited to NLP-based techniques or NLP-like applications only.\n5.

This research aims to identify ethical considerations that arise in the design and development of these two technologies in combination. Using LLMs for social robotics may provide benefits, such as enabling natural language open-domain dialogues. However, the intersection of these two technologies also gives rise to ethical concerns related to misinformation, non-verbal cues, emotional disruption, and biases. The robot\u2019s physical social embodiment adds complexity, as ethical hazards associated with LLM-based Social AI, such as hallucinations and misinformation, can be exacerbated due to the effects of physical embodiment on social perception and communication. To address these challenges, this study employs an empirical design justice-based methodology, focusing on identifying socio-technical ethical considerations through a qualitative co-design and interaction study. The purpose of the study is to identify ethical considerations relevant to the process of co-design of, and interaction with a humanoid social robot as the interface of a LLM, and to evaluate how a design justice methodology can be used in the context of designing LLMs-based social robotics.\n\n**Major Findings:**\n\n1.

The study also considers critical barriers to implementing GPTs at each step of the supply chain and proposes initial measures to overcome these obstacles.\n\n**Major Findings:**\n\n1. LLMs, such as GPTs, can be integrated into training modules for farm workers to explain the lifecycle and transmission pathways of Campylobacter in poultry farms. They can also simulate interactive scenarios where workers must choose the best practices to prevent contamination at rearing.\n2. LLMs can provide customized summaries of HACCP and GHP guidelines that are most relevant to a specific farm's operations. They can emphasize specific control points like chilling during processing, where Campylobacter is most likely to spread, and generate step-by-step checklists for daily, weekly, and monthly hygiene practices tailored to the scale and specific setup of the farm.\n3. LLMs can serve as a real-time advisory tool, a conversational \"digital poultry advisor,\" assisting poultry farm workers in making informed decisions when unexpected situations arise. For instance, if a section of a poultry farm reports a sudden increase in temperature or a breakdown in equipment used for processing, the LLM can suggest immediate actions to mitigate any potential increase in Campylobacter risk due to these changes.\n\n**Analysis and Critique:**\n\nThe study presents an intriguing potential for LLMs to enhance food safety, but the 'LLM \u2013 food safety' interface remains largely underexplored.

{"id": "2406.06822v1", "text": "**Summary:**\n\nThe paper introduces CodeBreaker, a pioneering LLM-assisted backdoor attack framework on code completion models. Unlike recent attacks that embed malicious payloads in detectable or irrelevant sections of the code, CodeBreaker leverages LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for sophisticated payload transformation, ensuring that both the poisoned data for fine-tuning and generated code can evade strong vulnerability detection. CodeBreaker stands out with its comprehensive coverage of vulnerabilities, making it the first to provide such an extensive set for evaluation.\n\n**Major Findings:**\n\n1. CodeBreaker is the first LLM-assisted backdoor attack on code completion against strong vulnerability detection, ensuring that both the poisoned data (for fine-tuning) and the generated insecure suggestions (during inferences) are undetectable by static analysis tools.\n2. CodeBreaker can bypass the LLMs-based vulnerability detection, which has been empirically shown to be more powerful than static analyses.\n3. CodeBreaker injects malicious payloads in the code, ensuring that the attack can be launched even if comments are not loaded for fine-tuning. It is also designed for easy activation and can be effectively triggered by any code or string triggers.\n4. CodeBreaker aims to minimize the code transformation for better stealthiness and provides a novel framework to tune the stealthiness and evasion performance per their tradeoff.\n5. CodeBreaker takes the first cut to analyze static analysis rules for 247 vulnerabilities, categorizing them into dataflow analysis, string matching, and constant analysis. It also considers text trigger and different code triggers in its attack settings.\n\n**Analysis and Critique:**\n\nWhile CodeBreaker presents a significant advancement in backdoor attacks on code completion models, there are potential limitations and areas for improvement. The reliance on LLMs for payload transformation and obfuscation may introduce new vulnerabilities in the LLMs themselves, as they are used to facilitate adversarial attacks.

{"id": "2406.06737v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe Raccoon benchmark is a novel evaluation framework designed to assess the vulnerability of LLM-integrated applications to prompt theft. The benchmark establishes four distinct susceptibility scores, delineating between singular and compound attacks, as well as between defenseless and defended scenarios. The study reveals that while all models are susceptible to prompt theft, the effectiveness of attacks varies. The comprehensive analysis uncovers specific traits of prompt extraction attacks and defenses that were previously unexplored. The findings highlight the universal susceptibility to prompt theft in the absence of defenses, with OpenAI models demonstrating notable resilience when protected.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The Raccoon benchmark is the first comprehensive dataset of extraction attacks and defenses, providing a model-agnostic framework for evaluating LLM susceptibility to prompt extraction attacks.\n2. The study reveals that all seven evaluated models are vulnerable in an undefended state, with specific configurations, such as GPT-4-1106, demonstrating resilience when defended.\n3. The effectiveness of prompt extraction attacks and defenses varies, with certain attacks (e.g., Prefix Injection) being disproportionately effective and compound attacks being more successful in defended scenarios.\n4. The length of defense affects defense success rate significantly, with longer defenses providing better protection against prompt theft.\n5. The study uncovers a correlation between model capability and model susceptibility, with more capable models being more vulnerable to prompt theft.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe Raccoon benchmark provides a valuable resource for the research community to evaluate and enhance model robustness against prompt theft. However, the study has some limitations. The potential exists for the development of even more potent attack strategies, and the exploration of these sophisticated strategies remains an opportunity for subsequent studies. Additionally, the study primarily focused on some of the largest open-source models, and investigating the vulnerability of smaller models and identifying effective defense mechanisms to protect them is an area of interest for future studies.\n\nThe study also raises ethical concerns, as the findings could be misused by malicious entities.

Over 2000 students made over 100,000 requests of the bot across two semesters. The assistant offers one-shot, contextual feedback through a \"Get Help\" button in a popular code editor and a \"get feedback\" feature within an autograder. The bot identifies the assignment and collects student code, wrapping it in a custom prompt to support pedagogical goals and avoid providing direct solutions. The paper reports on the development process, deployment, and analysis of possible impacts on students, primarily through student feedback and homework completion times.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. **Reduction in homework completion time**: The study found substantial reductions in homework completion time, with the most pronounced effects for students in the 75th percentile, with reductions of over 30 minutes.\n2. **No clear transfer of effects to other contexts**: It is not clear that these effects transfer to assignment contexts where the Bot is not available. Some contexts showed speedups, while others showed no change or even a slowdown.\n3. **Potential over-reliance or dependency effect**: There is weak evidence of a potential over-reliance or dependency effect, with performance degradation on bot-never-available labs and students reporting that labs take much longer than they would if the bot were available.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits and drawbacks of using an AI-based homework assistant in a large CS1 course. The reduction in homework completion time is a significant finding, as it suggests that the bot can help students complete their work more efficiently. However, the lack of clear transfer of these effects to other contexts and the potential over-reliance or dependency effect raise important questions about the bot's overall impact on student learning.\n\nFurther research is needed to disentangle these effects and better understand the bot's role in student learning.

PaCE aims to address the challenges of existing alignment methods, such as costly fine-tuning, inadequate removal of undesirable concepts, and harming linguistic capabilities. The framework consists of two stages: (1) Concept Construction and Partition, and (2) Activation Decomposition and Intervention.\n\nPaCE constructs a large-scale concept dictionary in the activation space, where each atom corresponds to a semantic concept. Given an alignment task, a concept partitioner efficiently annotates the concepts as benign or undesirable. At inference time, PaCE decomposes the LLM activations along the concept dictionary via sparse coding to accurately represent the activation as a linear combination of benign and undesirable components. By removing the latter ones from the activation, PaCE reorients the behavior of LLMs towards alignment goals.\n\nThe paper demonstrates that PaCE achieves state-of-the-art alignment performance on tasks such as response detoxification, faithfulness enhancement, and sentiment revising, while maintaining linguistic capabilities. The collected dataset for concept representations is available at <https://github.com/peterljq/Parsimonious-Concept-Engineering>.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1.

Instead, they argue that measurable semantic characteristics of LLM confabulations mirror a human propensity to utilize increased narrativity as a cognitive resource for sense-making and communication.\n\nThe authors analyze popular hallucination benchmarks and reveal that hallucinated outputs display increased levels of narrativity and semantic coherence relative to veridical outputs.

{"id": "2406.03636v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe paper presents a novel method called Synthetic Programming Elicitation and Compilation (SPEAC) for generating syntactically correct code from Large Language Models (LLMs) in very low resource programming languages (VLPLs). The approach is fundamentally different from existing prompting, decoding, and fine-tuning strategies. It is inspired by natural programming elicitation, a technique used to help programming language designers understand how programmers naturally approach problems.\n\nThe key idea behind SPEAC is to design an intermediate language that LLMs naturally know how to use and can be automatically compiled to the target VLPL. The paper introduces a case study using Python as the parent language, UCLID5 as the target language, and a subset of Python as the child language. UCLID5 is a language used for formal modeling and verification of state transition systems, which has limited code examples and is not frequently found in other programming languages.\n\nThe paper demonstrates that SPEAC produces syntactically correct programs more frequently than existing retrieval and fine-tuning baselines without sacrificing semantic correctness. The approach uses deductive techniques to automatically repair programs generated by LLMs that are in the child language but not in the target VLPL. When these deductive techniques are unable to fully repair a program, a hole is inserted, and an LLM is asked to finish the repair, repeating as necessary.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1.

The framework processes the entire input by interleaving reading and reasoning, and mitigates long context focus issues by assigning each agent a short context. Comprehensive evaluation on a wide range of long-context tasks in question answering, summarization, and code completion demonstrates significant improvements over strong baselines of RAG, Full-Context, and multi-agent LLMs.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. CoA is a training-free, task-agnostic, and highly interpretable framework that processes the entire input by interleaving reading and reasoning, and mitigates long context focus issues by assigning each agent a short context.\n2.

One limitation is that CoA does not explore other forms of communication approaches, such as debating or complex discussions.

However, the understanding of their inner workings is still limited. This study investigates the conventional wisdom that preference learning trains models to assign higher likelihoods to more preferred outputs than less preferred outputs, measured via ranking accuracy. Surprisingly, most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 70% on common preference datasets. The study further derives the idealized ranking accuracy that a preference-tuned LLM would achieve if it optimized the DPO or RLHF objective perfectly. The results show that existing models exhibit a significant alignment gap \u2013 a gap between the observed and idealized ranking accuracies. This discrepancy is attributed to the DPO objective, which is empirically and theoretically ill-suited to fix even mild ranking errors in the reference model.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 70% on common preference datasets.\n2.

The study aims to reassess the need for large language models in sequential recommendation and investigate the effects of reducing the number of parameters during training and inference stages.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The authors discover that most intermediate layers of LLMs are redundant, which motivates them to empower small language models for sequential recommendation (SLMRec) using a simple yet effective knowledge distillation method.\n2. SLMRec attains the best performance using only 13% of the parameters found in LLM-based recommendation models, while simultaneously achieving up to 6.6x and 8.0x speedups in training and inference time costs, respectively.\n3. The proposed SLMRec model, with a model size of less than 1 billion parameters, can deliver performance that is remarkably competitive with baselines using LLMs sized over 7 billion parameters.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n1.

The authors demonstrate that frontier LLMs can perform inductive OOCR, as evidenced by a suite of five tasks. In one experiment, an LLM was finetuned on a corpus consisting only of distances between an unknown city and other known cities. Remarkably, the LLM could verbalize that the unknown city is Paris and use this fact to answer downstream questions without in-context learning or Chain of Thought. Further experiments showed that LLMs trained only on individual coin flip outcomes could verbalize whether the coin is biased, and those trained only on pairs could articulate a definition of a function and compute inverses. However, OOCR was found to be unreliable, particularly for smaller LLMs learning complex structures. The ability of LLMs to \"connect the dots\" without explicit in-context learning poses a potential obstacle to monitoring and controlling the knowledge acquired by LLMs.\n\n**Major Findings:**\n\n1. Frontier LLMs can perform inductive OOCR, inferring latent information from evidence distributed across training documents and applying it to downstream tasks without in-context learning.\n2.

PostMark does not require access to the underlying model's logits, unlike most existing watermarking algorithms. The method is based on the intuition that a text's semantics should not drastically change after watermarking or paraphrasing. PostMark uses an embedding model, a secret word embedding table, and an insertion model implemented via an instruction-following LLM. The paper presents extensive experiments across eight baseline algorithms, five base LLMs, and three datasets, demonstrating that PostMark offers superior robustness to paraphrasing attacks compared to existing methods.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. PostMark consistently achieves a high true positive rate (TPR) before paraphrasing and maintains a higher TPR after paraphrasing compared to other baselines, including Blackbox, the only other method that operates under the same logit-free condition.\n2. PostMark is more robust than the three baselines that also condition on input semantics: SemStamp, k-SemStamp, and SIR.\n3. Logit-based baselines perform worse on low-entropy models and tasks, while PostMark stays relatively unaffected.\n4. An open-weight combination of Llama-3-70B-Inst and nomic-embed can also achieve promising robustness to paraphrasing attacks, showcasing the modular design of PostMark.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n1.

The benchmark is designed to probe the models' temporal reasoning skills, with all questions human-annotated according to a carefully constructed ability taxonomy.\n3. MMBench-Video employs GPT-4 for automated assessment, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness over earlier LLM-based evaluations.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n1. While MMBench-Video offers a more comprehensive evaluation of LVLMs, it may not encompass every video topic and fine-grained capability, potentially limiting its ability to reflect the video understanding capabilities of VLMs in specific tasks or scenarios.\n2. The use of GPT-4 for automated assessment, while demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness, may introduce biases or limitations inherent in the model's design and training data.\n3. The benchmark's reliance on YouTube videos may limit its generalizability to other video platforms or types of video content.\n4. The benchmark's focus on temporal reasoning skills may overlook other important aspects of video understanding, such as spatial reasoning or object recognition.\n5. The benchmark's use of free-form questions may introduce variability in the difficulty and complexity of the questions, potentially affecting the reliability and validity of the evaluation.\n6.

The authors perform ablations to understand why and how this additional training signal helps in model distillation. They report some potentially surprising results:\n\n1. Placing CoT sequences after labels (rather than before) results in better downstream performance. This means that no student \"reasoning\" is necessary at test time to realize gains.\n2. When rationales are appended in this way, they need not be coherent reasoning sequences to yield improvements. Performance increases are robust to permutations of CoT tokens.\n3. A small number of key tokens are sufficient to achieve improvements equivalent to those observed when full rationales are used in model distillation.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. CoT-augmented distillation works better when rationales are provided after labels. Standard CoT reasoning elicited zero-shot from massive LMs yields rationales as prefixes that logically lead to the label tokens. However, smaller models perform consistently better when rationales follow labels in distillation targets.\n2. When appended to target labels, token-level order, length, and coherence of rationales does not matter. However, these things do matter when rationales are preprended. When the rationales are placed before the final label during fine-tuning, masking, shuffling, or altering coherent rationales significantly degrades model performance.\n3. Motivated by the preceding observations, the authors run controlled experiments to establish that there are certain key, contextual tokens that connect the input to the final label, and appending these tokens to labels is sufficient to achieve performance on-par with coherent CoT-like rationales. It is solely the presence of these tokens at training time that leads to downstream performance improvements.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n* The paper provides valuable insights into the role of CoT reasoning in model distillation, highlighting the importance of the position of rationales and the presence of key tokens.\n* The findings challenge the assumption that student models benefit from learning to mimic the relevant \"reasoning\"", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14511v1.pdf", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2406.14511v1", "abs": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14511v1"}, "authors": "Somin Wadhwa, Silvio Amir, Byron C.

The authors generated 720 persuasive messages on 10 U.S. political issues using 24 language models of varying sizes. They then deployed these messages in a large-scale randomized survey experiment to estimate the persuasive capability of each model. The findings reveal a log scaling law, where model persuasiveness is characterized by sharply diminishing returns. This means that current frontier models are barely more persuasive than models smaller in size by an order of magnitude or more.

The authors argue that previous research suggesting grounding objectives reduce hallucination is not empirically justified, as it relies on flawed evaluation protocols. The current study offers a systematic analysis of the effect of fine-grained object grounding on LVLM hallucination under a more realistic evaluation protocol. The results of extensive experiments over three backbone LLMs reveal that grounding objectives have little to no effect on object hallucination in open caption generation.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The study finds that under a sound evaluation protocol, including grounding objectives\u2014referring expressions and grounded captioning\u2014to LVLM training has little to no effect on object hallucination, both in QA-based evaluation and open-ended captioning.\n2. Enforcing generation of grounded captions at inference time slightly reduces object hallucinations but the effect is small and comes at the cost of (slight) reduction in caption detailedness.\n3. A qualitative inspection of grounded captions also confirms that forcing the model to generate a bounding box for mentioned objects most often does not prevent it from hallucinating content.\n4.

Q* aims to alleviate the pathology of LLMs, which are prone to produce errors, hallucinations, and inconsistent statements when performing multi-step reasoning due to their auto-regressive nature. By learning a plug-and-play Q-value model as a heuristic function, Q* can effectively guide LLMs to select the most promising next step without fine-tuning LLMs for each task, avoiding significant computational overhead and potential performance degeneration on other tasks.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Q* formalizes the multi-step reasoning of LLMs as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the state is the input prompt and the reasoning steps generated so far, the action is the next step of reasoning, and the reward measures how well the task is solved.\n2. The paper presents several general approaches to estimate the optimal Q-value of state-action pairs, including offline reinforcement learning, best sequence from rollout, and completion with stronger LLMs. These methods only need the ground truth of training problems and can be easily applied to various reasoning tasks without modification.\n3. Q* casts solving multi-step reasoning tasks as a heuristic search problem, where the objective is to find the most proper reasoning trace with maximum utility. Built upon A* search, Q* leverages plug-and-play Q-value models as a heuristic function and guides LLMs to select the most promising next reasoning step in a best-first fashion.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nWhile Q* demonstrates promising results in improving the multi-step reasoning capability of LLMs, there are some potential limitations and areas for further research.\n\n1.

Furthermore, the paper demonstrates an application of safety neurons in detecting unsafe outputs before generation, improving model safety by refusing to respond when harmful content is detected.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Safety neurons are sparse and effective, with intervention on about 5% of all neurons restoring up to 90% of safety performance.\n2. Safety neurons encode transferable mechanisms, exhibiting consistent effectiveness on different red-teaming datasets.\n3. The findings of safety neurons interpret the \"alignment tax,\" which refers to the trade-off between harmlessness and helpfulness in LLMs.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe paper provides a novel approach to understanding the inner workings of safety alignment in LLMs by identifying and analyzing safety neurons. The proposed methods, generation-time activation contrasting and dynamic activation patching, offer valuable insights into the causal effects of these neurons on safety behaviors. However, the paper does not address potential limitations or biases in the methodology, such as the generalizability of the findings to other LLMs or the impact of different model architectures on the results.

These challenges include limited prompt length, unstructured item information, and unconstrained generation of recommendations. The TaxRec approach uses a taxonomy dictionary to categorize and organize items, improving the clarity and structure of item information. By incorporating the taxonomy dictionary into LLM prompts, the method achieves efficient token utilization and controlled feature generation, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant recommendations. The approach features a two-step process: one-time taxonomy categorization and LLM-based recommendation, enabling zero-shot recommendations without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that TaxRec significantly enhances recommendation quality compared to traditional zero-shot approaches.\n\n## Major Findings:\n1. The use of a taxonomy dictionary provides a systematic framework for categorizing and organizing items, enhancing the structure and clarity of item information.\n2.

The authors propose three attack methods inspired by cognitive and social psychology principles: Disguise, Deception, and Teaching. These methods are used to build evaluation datasets for four common bias types: age, gender, race, and sex orientation. The study finds that all three attack methods effectively elicit LLMs' inner bias, with Deception attacks being the most effective. The results also show that GLM-3 performs the best in defending against these attacks, compared to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The study further reveals that LLMs could output content of other bias types when being taught with one type of bias.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. All three attack methods (Disguise, Deception, and Teaching) can successfully elicit LLMs' inner bias, with Deception attacks being the most effective.\n2. Regarding bias performance, the ranking from less to more is GLM-3, GPT-4, and GPT-3.5, probably due to the stricter regulation of LLMs in China.\n3. The LLMs have demonstrated less bias in the bias types that draw more social attention, e.g., gender and race.\n4. Notably, when Teaching attacks provide LLMs with one type of bias examples (e.g., race), other types of bias can be elicited (gender, religion) from LLMs, showing the inherent bias in the models.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe paper provides a novel and rigorous approach to evaluating implicit bias in LLMs. The use of psychometric principles to design attack methods is a significant contribution to the field. However, the study has some limitations. The evaluation data is adapted from four important bias categories of the CBBQ dataset, which is a bias dataset extracted from Chinese corpora.

Unlike existing outcome-based benchmarks, Mr-Ben focuses on the process of reasoning, demanding a meta-reasoning skill from LLMs. The benchmark comprises 5,975 questions collected from human experts, covering various subjects such as physics, chemistry, logic, coding, and more.\n\n## Major Findings:\n\n1. Mr-Ben is a comprehensive benchmark that employs a meta-reasoning paradigm, where LLMs are challenged to reason about different forms of reasoning. This paradigm involves LLMs acting as teachers, evaluating the reasoning process by assessing correctness, analyzing potential errors, and providing corrections.\n\n2. The analyses of various LLMs on Mr-Ben reveal distinct limitations and previously unidentified weaknesses in their reasoning abilities. While many LLMs can generate the correct answer to a question, they struggle to pinpoint errors in the reasoning process and correct them. This suggests that existing LLMs have yet to master reasoning, particularly the smaller models.\n\n3. Techniques such as the use of high-quality synthetic data can significantly improve reasoning abilities, offering a potential pathway to enhance performance regardless of model size. However, different LLMs excel in different reasoning paradigms, challenging the assumption that domain-specific enhancements necessarily lead to broad cognitive improvements.\n\n## Analysis and Critique:\n\nWhile Mr-Ben provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' reasoning abilities, it has some limitations. The benchmark's applicability may be restricted when it comes to subjects that are inherently holistic or creative in nature, such as humanities or sociology. Additionally, Mr-Ben is currently confined to questions in English, which could potentially limit the scope of reasoning challenges that can be explored.

The framework is evaluated using TutorCode, a large-scale uncrawled benchmark consisting of 1,239 C++ defect codes and associated information. The study assesses the realistic repair capabilities of 12 prominent LLMs and demonstrates the significant difference in performance on HumanEval and TutorCode. The experimental results show that tutor guidance significantly improves the repair performance of LLMs, while failing test cases have a limited impact due to the lengthy prompt problem. To mitigate this issue, a strategy called MultiRegenerate is proposed, which repairs incorrect code through three distinct conversational sessions. Cref outperforms the baseline and T&S&F in terms of AVG-5 and RPSR metrics and yields superior AVG-5 and comparable RPSR results compared to MultiRegenerate. The study concludes that incorporating historical failing repairs can significantly enhance repair capabilities in LLMs by fully exploiting their conversational potential.

The authors start by discussing traditional CI techniques when variables of interest are assumed to be fully observed. They then provide an in-depth discussion of various CI strategies to handle latent variables, covering the tasks of causal effect estimation, mediation analysis, counterfactual reasoning, and causal discovery. The authors also generalize the discussion to graph data where interference among units may exist. Finally, they offer fresh aspects for further advancement of CI with latent variables, especially new opportunities in the era of large language models (LLMs).\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The lack of observation of important variables (e.g., confounders, mediators, exogenous variables) severely compromises the reliability of CI methods.\n2. Various consequences can be incurred if latent variables are carelessly handled, such as biased estimation of causal effects, incomplete understanding of causal mechanisms, and lack of individual-level causal consideration.\n3. Circumvention-based methods eschew direct modeling of latent variables, while inference-based methods explicitly model the latent variables based on the observations.\n4.

{"id": "2406.13662v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe paper introduces a novel method called ObscurePrompt for jailbreaking Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach is inspired by the fragile alignments observed in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. The method begins by constructing a base prompt that integrates well-known jailbreaking techniques and then utilizes powerful LLMs to obscure the original prompt through iterative transformations. The goal is to bolster the attack's robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ObscurePrompt substantially improves upon previous methods in terms of attack effectiveness and maintains efficacy against two prevalent defense mechanisms.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The paper introduces a novel and straightforward approach named ObscurePrompt to jailbreaking LLMs using obscure inputs. This method is training-free and operates in a black-box setting, meaning it does not require access to the internal architecture of the target LLMs.\n2. The observation about LLMs' fragile alignment on OOD data is a key finding. By visualizing the representations of different queries within the hidden states of LLMs, it was observed that OOD queries (i.e., obscure queries) can significantly weaken the ethical decision boundary.\n3. Comprehensive experiments are performed to validate the efficacy of the method, which demonstrates superior performance over existing baselines for both black-box and white-box attacks. Other key findings from the experiments include: (1) the number of integrated prompts significantly influences the attack success rate; (2) combining all types of jailbreak strategies does not necessarily result in the most effective attack; (3) the proposed method remains effective against mainstream defenses.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n1. The paper provides a fresh perspective on jailbreaking LLMs by focusing on the use of obscure inputs. This approach addresses the inadequacies in current LLM safety measures against OOD data.\n2. The method is straightforward and does not require access to the internal parameters of the target LLMs, making it more practical and applicable than previous methods.\n3. The paper's reliance on specific and fixed prompt templates may limit its generalizability. Future research could explore more flexible and adaptable methods for generating obscure inputs.\n4.

They demonstrate that a small amount of potentially auxiliary data can 'jog' the memory of unlearned models, causing them to behave similarly to their pre-unlearning state. The authors formalize this unlearning-relearning pipeline for LLMs and conduct case studies on three popular unlearning benchmarks: WMDP, TOFU, and Who's Harry Potter (WHP). The results show that their relearning attack can successfully drive the model to output unlearned knowledge under various practical settings.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The targeted relearning attack is effective in recovering unlearned hazardous knowledge in the WMDP benchmark using public articles.\n2. The attack can also successfully relearn private information in the TOFU and WHP datasets when using a small and highly limited subset of unlearned data as the relearn set.\n3. The study reveals that evaluating query completions on the unlearned model alone may give a false sense of unlearning quality.\n4. The approach of using benign public information to finetune the unlearned model is surprisingly effective in recovering unlearned knowledge.\n5. The study motivates the exploration of unlearning heuristics beyond approximate, gradient-based optimization to produce more robust baselines for machine unlearning.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe authors' work provides valuable insights into the limitations of current unlearning methods and the potential for targeted relearning attacks. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further exploration:\n\n1. The study focuses on finetuning-based unlearning schemes, and it would be interesting to see if the proposed attack can be generalized to other unlearning approaches.\n2. The authors mention the need to study the relation between the relearn set and the queries used for evaluation, as the relearn set might contain direct answers to the evaluation queries. This aspect could be further investigated to ensure that relearning occurs due to triggering the memory of the approximately unlearned model, rather than simply learning the knowledge again from scratch.\n3.

Cross-lingual contamination can easily fool existing detection methods, but not the proposed generalization-based methods.\n2.

{"id": "2406.12702v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe article introduces two paradoxes concerning jailbreak of foundation models: the impossibility of constructing a perfect jailbreak classifier and the inability of a weaker model to consistently detect whether a stronger model is jailbroken or not. The authors provide formal proofs for these paradoxes and a short case study on Llama and GPT4-o to demonstrate their findings. The article discusses the broader theoretical and practical repercussions of these results.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. **Impossibility of Perfect Jailbreak Classifiers**: The authors prove that it is impossible to construct a universal and perfect jailbreak classifier for any model, irrespective of its power and alignment. This is due to the lack of a fixed and deterministic definition of alignment, which makes it impossible to prevent any model from getting jailbroken.\n\n2. **Weaker Models Cannot Detect Jailbreaks in Stronger Models**: The authors show that weaker models cannot detect whether a stronger model is jailbroken or not. This is because there is a pareto-dominant relationship between two models, where one model performs better than the other in at least one capability. In such cases, the weaker model cannot confidently classify or encode the input, which implies it cannot classify both with high confidence.\n\n3. **Practical Repercussions**: The authors discuss the practical repercussions of these results on jailbreak research.

Snap consists of three key steps: 1) negative instruction generation, which utilizes GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 to build the forgetting set; 2) hard retaining data augmentation, which creates related instructions and their normal responses to build the retaining set; and 3) OT unlearning, which involves the Wasserstein regularization that enforces adequate change in weights from the initial parameters of the LLM. The framework is evaluated on various NLP benchmarks and demonstrates the ability to retain the original LLM capabilities while successfully unlearning the specified information.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The paper introduces the notion of negative instructions that are used to train LLMs to generate obliterated responses.\n2. The paper proposes Hard Retaining Data Augmentation and demonstrates that hard positives are effective for selective unlearning.\n3. The paper presents the novel Wasserstein Regularization that minimizes the change in parameters during instruction tuning.\n4. The paper successfully removes Peter Parker, as well as a set of other identities, from the LLM while retaining the original LLM capabilities.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe paper presents a promising approach to selectively unlearning information in LLMs using negative instructions. The use of hard retaining data augmentation and Wasserstein regularization are effective in retaining the original LLM performance while unlearning the specified information. However, the paper does not address the potential limitations of the framework, such as the scalability of the approach for larger LLMs or the impact of the unlearning process on the overall performance of the LLM.

On three tool-use benchmarks (m&m\u2019s, M3ToolEval, and API-Bank), CodeNav is competitive with tool-use without requiring arduous tool registration.\n4. The effect of library or tool description richness on code-use performance is studied.\n5.

{"id": "2406.12266v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThis work proposes a client-centered approach to assessing LLM (Large Language Model) therapists, called ClientCAST. The approach involves using LLMs to simulate clients, who then interact with LLM therapists and complete questionnaires about the interaction. The client-centered assessment results are derived from the completed questionnaires. Through experiments, it is found that LLMs can generally, though not perfectly, simulate clients, and they are able to distinguish high- and low-quality sessions by completing client-centered questionnaires. The work acknowledges that LLMs struggle to achieve perfect simulation and high levels of human trust in the short term, but argues that the imperfect simulation of LLMs can benefit humans in exploring specific tasks.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. LLMs can generally, though not perfectly, simulate clients, and they are able to distinguish high- and low-quality sessions by completing client-centered questionnaires.\n2. The performance of LLM therapists is significantly influenced by the underlying LLM, with more powerful LLMs achieving higher and more stable scores.\n3. LLM therapists can foster strong connections with clients, achieving comparable scores in terms of therapeutic alliance, but they are disadvantaged in reacting to clients\u2019 emotions, with lower scores in terms of positivity and smoothness compared to human therapists.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe proposed approach to assessing LLM therapists is a novel and promising direction for further analyses and studies. However, there are some limitations and ethical considerations to be aware of. One limitation is the inconsistency in the simulation of human behavior, which is observed in the field of counseling therapy. Neither the simulation of therapists nor clients is perfect, and LLMs face challenges in accurately simulating the personalities of human clients. However, more powerful LLMs can achieve higher simulation consistency and accuracy. Additionally, different LLMs exhibit inconsistency in various ways, which can be leveraged to simulate characters with diverse features.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, this work does not advocate for the use of LLMs in therapy, but rather proposes an assessment approach to reveal the characteristics of LLM therapists.

The authors propose the Instruction Vector (IV) framework to capture model representations highly related to specific instruction-following capabilities, making it possible to understand model-intrinsic forgetting. Through the analysis of IV dynamics pre and post-training, the authors suggest that fine-tuning mostly adds specialized reasoning patterns instead of erasing previous skills, which may appear as forgetting. The paper also introduces an IV-guided training method to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by preserving the original computation graph. Empirical tests on three benchmarks confirm the efficacy of this new approach.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The paper introduces a new perspective on catastrophic forgetting by using Knowledge and Instruction Probability to evaluate how well LLMs retain task-specific knowledge and follow instructions after tuning, showing that changes in instruction adherence mainly drive performance declines.\n2. The authors are the first to interpret forgetting with the Instruction Vector framework, identifying inherent changes during fine-tuning. The findings indicate that fine-tuning generally introduces specialized reasoning patterns rather than removing existing skills.\n3.

The survey also summarizes some prevailing approaches to evaluate LLMs in terms of alignment with human intentions and discusses the outlooks on the human intention alignment for LLMs.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Human preference learning can effectively align LLMs with human intentions by optimizing LLMs according to feedback information on their outputs that reflects the preferences and thus specifies the intentions of humans.\n2. The quality and scale of preference feedback are of great importance for human preference learning, while the sources of feedback collection can heavily influence them.\n3. The feedback formats adopted in works on human preference learning broadly include relative relations that are natural for preference expression but less informative, and absolute properties that are more informative about human preferences but harder to collect.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe survey provides a comprehensive review of the development timeline and recent advances in human preference learning for LLMs. However, it does not discuss the limitations and challenges of human preference learning for LLMs. For instance, the survey does not address the issue of bias in human preference feedback, which can lead to biased LLMs. Additionally, the survey does not discuss the potential risks of using LLMs to simulate human feedback, such as the risk of overfitting to the feedback data.

The framework is designed to address the limitations of single-team collaboration, which can only execute all phases sequentially according to its pre-defined team configuration, leading to repetitive errors and preventing self-correction. CTC enables different teams to concurrently propose task-oriented decisions as insights for content generation (single-team proposal) and then communicate for insights interchange in some important phases (multi-team aggregation). The experimental results in software development reveal a notable increase in quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the efficacy of the framework. The significant improvements in story generation demonstrate the promising generalization ability of the framework across various domains.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Cross-team communication for insights interchange significantly improves software quality, indicating the effectiveness of multi-team task handling. It mainly contributes to an appropriate increase in the diversity and effective grouping of content.\n2. As the number of participating teams increases, the quality of software is subject to diminishing returns and may even deteriorate. In our study, this is primarily attributed to the increased probability of low-quality software with more teams, which adversely affects the aggregated software quality. The pruning mechanism we introduced effectively addresses this issue.\n3. Our CTC framework has the potential for development in broader content generation domains, including natural language generation and programming language generation.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe paper presents an innovative approach to multi-team collaboration for content generation, particularly in software development and story generation.

LoTA allows for model merging across dramatically different tasks, achieving better performance than existing merging methods that rely on post hoc sparsification.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nWhile LoTA shows promising results, there are some potential limitations and areas for improvement:\n\n1. LoTA does not provide the compute efficiency of LoRA, which may be a disadvantage when the adapter needs to be compressed by more than 100x.\n2.

The models are validated across various languages, out-of-domain speedup, and GPT-4o evaluation.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The pretrain-and-finetune strategy for training drafters significantly enhances the speedup ratio relative to standard autoregressive decoding in multilingual translation tasks.\n2. The speedup ratio increases as the number of tokens specific to the target task used in training increases, with the speedup being logarithmically proportional to the scale of token count in drafter training.\n3. In multilingual translation, input languages consistent with the training set result in notable speedup, whereas outputs aligned with the training domain do not necessarily lead to improved performance.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe paper presents a novel approach to improving the efficiency of LLM inference in multilingual settings. However, the proposed method requires separate drafters for each language, which may introduce complexities in deployment, especially in multilingual settings.

The proposed method involves two stages: Opposite Prompt Optimization and Prompt-based Contrastive Decoding.

The framework leverages a state-of-the-art large language module to extract objects and construct a knowledge graph to predict the locations of these objects in potentially generated images. It then integrates a controllable image generation model with a visual text generation module to generate an image that is consistent with the original prompt, guided by the predicted object locations.\n\n**Major Findings:**\n\n1. PCIG significantly enhances the alignment of generated images with their corresponding descriptions, addressing the inconsistency between visual output and textual input.\n2. The framework leverages state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing and computer vision, including large language models (LLMs) and controllable diffusion models.\n3. PCIG addresses three key aspects of consistency: (1) general objects, ensuring accurate depiction of object attributes and placement; (2) text within the image, generating legible and correct text; and (3) objects that refer to proper nouns existing in the real world, which cannot be directly generated by the model.\n4. Through extensive experiments on an advanced multimodal hallucination benchmark, PCIG demonstrates superior performance in terms of object hallucination accuracy, textual hallucination accuracy, and factual hallucination accuracy.\n\n**Analysis and Critique:**\n\nWhile PCIG shows promising results in generating images that align with the original prompt, there are some potential limitations and areas for improvement. For instance, the use of GPT4-turbo as the LLM for prompt analysis may introduce additional costs. Additionally, the framework may struggle with generating images with complex relationships and interactions between objects or with small text.

First, CoP currently only applies to multiple-choice questions or questions where the answer is a single token, making it challenging to define the model\u2019s confidence in the final prediction when the target word exceeds one token.

Second, the LLMs used in the experiments are brittle and do not always follow formatting instructions, resulting in a number of generations that cannot be analyzed. Third, due to compute constraints, the study could not experiment with models over 13B parameters, and 4-bit quantization was performed for each model.

ELCoRec addresses the numerical insensitivity problem by parallelly propagating numerical and categorical features using a GAT expert network, offering an informative user preference encoding that enhances LLM's understanding towards numerical features.\n2. The encoding overhead is alleviated by injecting the preference encoding into the LLM's semantic space via soft prompting at the cost of a single token embedding.\n3. The RAP template is proposed to better obtain user's recent interests and form the textual input of ELCoRec, which connects user history retrieved item sequence and recent item sequence along with the placeholder token for embedding injection.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe paper presents a novel approach to addressing the challenges of numerical insensitivity and encoding overhead in LLMs for recommendation tasks. The proposed ELCoRec framework and RAP template offer a promising solution to these issues by incorporating recent user interactions and leveraging a GAT expert network for feature encoding. However, the paper does not discuss potential limitations, unanswered questions, or conflicting evidence that may arise from the proposed method. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other existing methods that address similar challenges in LLMs for recommendation tasks.

These identified context-aware neurons are then strengthened via reweighting to steer LLMs towards generating context-sensitive outputs. The proposed method is evaluated across various models and tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in handling knowledge conflicts and offering a scalable, plug-and-play solution that can be integrated with existing models.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. IRCAN effectively identifies neurons responsible for processing context within LLMs and improves their fidelity to contextual knowledge.\n2. By enhancing context-aware neurons, LLMs can be guided to remain more faithful to the information provided in the context when facing knowledge conflicts.\n3.

The paper pioneers the exploration of attribution methods to knowledge conflicts for LLMs, offering a novel approach to resolving knowledge conflicts.\n2. The proposed attribution method based on integrated gradients accurately reflects the importance of neurons and is invariant to implementation details.\n3. The paper conducts extensive experiments on a diverse array of models and tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving the performance of LLMs on tasks involving knowledge conflicts.\n4.

{"id": "2406.18403v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe paper presents Judge-Bench, a comprehensive set of 20 datasets annotated by humans, for a range of quality dimensions. The study aims to assess the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to act as judges in evaluating NLP tasks. The datasets cover a wide span of properties, ranging from grammaticality and toxicity to coherence, factual consistency, and verbosity. The study focuses on English datasets or language pairs which include English as one of the languages. The paper evaluates 11 LLMs, including both open-weight and proprietary models, for their ability to replicate the annotations. The results show that each LLM exhibits a large variance across datasets in its correlation to human judgments, indicating that LLMs are not yet ready to systematically replace human judges in NLP.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The study finds that some LLMs correlate well with human judgments on some datasets, indicating that they could be used as valid surrogates. However, each tested LLM performs poorly on some others and exhibits significant variance across datasets.\n2. The decreasing gap between open and closed models is observed, with the overall best-performing LLM in the evaluation being GPT-4o, with Llama3-70B coming in a close second. This seems promising with respect to the reproducibility of future evaluation efforts.\n3. The study finds that current LLMs and/or their prompts need to be calibrated against actual human judgments on every new dataset to establish the validity of their evaluation scores.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n* The study highlights the limitations of using LLMs as judges of linguistic output, as they are not actual humans and may be prone to errors or systematic biases that differ from those of humans.\n* The study raises concerns over the reproducibility of evaluations conducted with proprietary models, as they may be retrained or retired at any time, rendering comparisons between this month\u2019s and last month\u2019s judgments invalid.\n* The study notes that most LLMs do not disclose their training data, which makes it impossible to check for definitive data leakage from existing benchmarks and undermines the ability to make broad, generalisable claims beyond the single specific dataset under analysis", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18403v1.pdf", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2406.18403v1", "abs": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18403v1"}, "authors": "Anna Bavaresco, Raffaella Bernardi, Leonardo Bertolazzi, Desmond Elliott, Raquel Fern\u00e1ndez, Albert Gatt, Esam Ghaleb, Mario Giulianelli, Michael Hanna, Alexander Koller, Andr\u00e9 F.

Experiments on the CONVAI2 dataset demonstrate that SPT significantly improves response diversity and other critical performance indicators.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. SPT enhances response diversity by up to 90% compared to traditional methods, such as textual prompting and direct fine-tuning.\n2.

The study is based on 17 Java projects, five widely-used open-source LLMs with different structures and parameter sizes, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. The findings highlight the significant influence of various prompt factors, show the performance of open-source LLMs compared to the commercial GPT-4 and the traditional Evosuite, and identify limitations in LLM-based unit test generation. The study also derives a series of implications for future research and practical use of LLM-based unit test generation.\n\n# Major Findings:\n\n1. The prompt design, including the description style and selected code features, is crucial to the effectiveness of LLMs in unit test generation. It is recommended to align the description style with the training data and choose code features considering the LLMs\u2019 code comprehension ability and the space left for generating unit tests.\n2. The conclusions drawn from open-source LLMs in other tasks do not necessarily generalize to unit test generation, including dominance relationships among studied LLMs. However, all studied LLMs, including the state-of-the-art GPT-4, underperform traditional Evosuite in terms of test coverage. This is primarily due to the large percentage of syntactically invalid unit tests generated by LLMs, a result of LLMs\u2019 hallucination.\n3. Directly adapting the Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for unit test generation does not improve effectiveness and may even reduce it in some cases. CoT is primarily limited by the LLMs\u2019 code comprehension ability, while RAG is constrained by the significant gap between the retrieved unit tests and those that LLMs excel at generating. Special design for the use of ICL methods in unit test generation is required.\n4. The defect detection ability of LLM-generated unit tests is limited, primarily due to their low validity. Although valid unit tests are generated by LLMs for many defects, a significant number of defects remain undetected, mainly because the tests fail to produce the specific inputs necessary to trigger these defects. Therefore, designing effective mutation strategies for the inputs within generated unit tests could further improve defect detection effectiveness.\n\n", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18181v1.pdf", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2406.18181v1", "abs": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18181v1"}, "authors": "Lin Yang, Chen Yang, Shutao Gao, Weijing Wang, Bo Wang, Qihao Zhu, Xiao Chu, Jianyi Zhou, Guangtai Liang, Qianxiang Wang, Junjie Chen", "title": "An Empirical Study of Unit Test Generation with Large Language Models", "subtitle": "TL;DR: Study explores open-source LLMs for unit test generation, comparing them to commercial GPT-4 and traditional Evosuite, highlighting prompt factors and limitations.", "categories": ["education", "prompt-engineering", "robustness"], "publish_date": "2024-06-26", "model": "accounts/fireworks/models/mixtral-8x22b-instruct", "temperature": 0.1, "image": null, "word_count": 13168, "extraction": "HTML", "is_truncated": false}}

The method involves training two specialized models: the Sentinel Model, which fosters safety, and the Intruder Model, designed to generate riskier responses.

The authors utilized reports and posts from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), Twitter, and Reddit as their corpora. Their goal was to extract three types of entities: vaccine, shot, and adverse event (ae). They explored and fine-tuned multiple LLMs, including GPT-2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama-2 7b, and Llama-2 13b, as well as traditional deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT). To enhance performance, they created ensembles of the three models with the best performance. The ensemble model achieved the highest performance in \"vaccine,\" \"shot,\" and \"ae,\" with strict F1-scores of 0.878, 0.930, and 0.925, respectively, along with a micro-average score of 0.903. These results underscore the significance of fine-tuning models for specific tasks and demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble methods in enhancing performance.\n\n**Major Findings:**\n\n1. Fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs, such as GPT-2 and GPT-3.5, played a pivotal role in enhancing their ability to recognize entities related to AEs.\n2.

The researchers tested the AdvBench benchmark in Standardized Arabic, finding that even with prompt manipulation techniques like prefix injection, it was insufficient to provoke LLMs into generating unsafe content. However, when using Arabic transliteration and chatspeak (or arabizi), they found that unsafe content could be produced on platforms like OpenAI GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet. The findings suggest that using Arabic and its various forms could expose information that might remain hidden, potentially increasing the risk of jailbreak attacks.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks when prompted with Arabic transliteration and chatspeak, but are robust to Arabic in its standardized form even with prefix injection techniques.\n2. Manual perturbations of the prompt at the sentence-level (adding words) and word-level (perturbing existing words) in Arabic standardized form and transliteration form can lead to unsafe content that was previously refused by the LLM.\n3. The use of Arabic chatspeak and transliteration could reveal LLM vulnerabilities that could be further exploited by adversaries.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe study provides valuable insights into the potential vulnerabilities of LLMs to jailbreak attacks when prompted with Arabic transliteration and chatspeak.

Techniques such as overlaying numeric IDs with minimal overlap, coloring both the internal of each segment\u2019s mask and its ID with the same unique color, and increasing the resolution of the marked image and the size layout of the markers can assist in making the markers more clear to the VLM.\n\n2. **Reference Image and Chain-of-Thoughts**: The authors propose techniques to ameliorate the issue of GPT-4v sometimes referring to regions with wrong IDs, especially in highly cluttered scenes. They suggest passing both the original (reference) and the marked image and constructing a text prompt that explains that the latter corresponds to annotated segments of the first. They also find that VLMs share similar properties with LLMs and prompting them to reason about their final answer before producing it can robustify the response quality.\n\n3. **Self-consistency and In-context Examples**: The authors observe that the outputs of GPT-4v are not always reproducible, even with exactly the same prompt.

The study focuses on table normalization as a stand-alone, one-time preprocessing step using LLMs to support symbolic reasoning on tabular data. The authors explore two key research questions: (1) How can LLMs' textual understanding be effectively utilized for data cleaning and transformation tasks, addressing challenges such as structural variance, mixed values, noise, and substring extraction in web tables? (2) How can web table normalization enhance table reasoning tasks, particularly in the context of LLM-based symbolic reasoning?\n\nThe proposed solution leverages the advanced textual understanding capabilities of LLMs to independently process and normalize web tables, without relying on specific questions. This approach allows for multiple questions to be asked from a single, normalized table, significantly enhancing reasoning and query capabilities. The normalization process only needs to be performed once, unlike other models that require repeated adjustments based on different questions.\n\nThe experimental evaluation conducted on challenging web table datasets such as WikiTableQuestions and TabFact demonstrates the effectiveness of NormTab in improving table reasoning performance.

The authors use LLMs for automated tagging and discover that some LLMs perform best when prompted with linguistic descriptions of the win probability at the time of the comment.

{"id": "2406.17675v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThis paper presents a comprehensive psychometrics benchmark for Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess their psychological attributes. The benchmark covers six psychological dimensions: personality, values, emotion, theory of mind, motivation, and intelligence. The study aims to deepen the understanding of LLMs' behaviors and predict their actions, inspired by how psychology facilitates understanding human behaviors. The benchmark includes a framework for psychological dimension identification, assessment dataset curation, and assessment with results validation. The findings reveal that LLMs manifest a broad spectrum of psychological attributes, with discrepancies between LLMs' self-reported traits and their behaviors in real-world scenarios. The study also uncovers concerns about the reliability of the test and the applicability of psychometric tests designed for humans to LLMs.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. LLMs show consistent behavior in tasks that require reasoning, such as theory of mind or emotional intelligence tasks. However, responses to preference-based questions, which do not have definitive answers, display significant variability across different models. Utilizing specific prompts (e.g., role-playing prompts) can improve response consistency toward designated attributes.\n2. LLMs may exhibit discrepancies between their self-reported traits and their behaviors in open-ended responses. For instance, a model might score low on extraversion in closed-form assessments yet demonstrate extraverted traits in open-ended responses. This discrepancy is also observed in human responses, where individuals may provide socially desirable answers on rating scales, whereas open-ended questions allow for more nuanced expressions that better reflect complex thoughts.\n3. LLMs are sensitive to prompt perturbations that humans might find trivial. This sensitivity can impact LLM performance and stability of their psychological attributes. Concerns remain about the reliability of the test, including the applicability of psychometric tests designed for humans to LLMs and the potential for measurement errors.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe study provides a thorough psychometric assessment of LLMs, offering insights into reliable evaluation and potential applications in AI and social sciences.

The authors propose a hierarchical taxonomy to organize the existing research into three research problems: self-assessment, exhibition, and recognition. The paper provides a thorough analysis of each problem, conducts in-depth investigations and comparisons of the corresponding methods, and consolidates findings and open challenges. The authors also collect publicly available resources, including personality inventories, code repositories, and datasets, to facilitate researchers and developers.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Self-assessment: Most studies rely on prompt engineering to instruct LLMs to complete questionnaires for personality assessment. However, there is no consensus on personality assessment results due to the diversity in assessment methods. Multiple studies agree that LLMs often exhibit darker traits than humans.\n2. Exhibition: Editing and inducing methods are used to control LLMs to reflect specified personality traits in the generated text content. Editing methods modify the model parameters of LLMs, while inducing methods utilize prompt engineering to induce LLMs to exhibit specific personalities.\n3. Recognition: LLMs can recognize personality traits from the given text content. LLMs can be used to enhance existing personality recognition models by augmenting the input data or providing additional features.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest studies on personality in LLMs. However, the authors acknowledge that most of the reviewed studies are from the perspective of computer science, which has led to their taxonomy being more based on a computer science viewpoint. The authors also highlight that some of the reviewed methods do not have a solid grounding in the social sciences. The authors hope that their survey can attract researchers from the social sciences to contribute more rational research methodologies from social science perspectives to Personality in LLMs.\n\nThe paper also acknowledges that the number of papers in this emerging domain has been increasing annually, indicating a growing interest in the field. However, the authors note that there is a relatively less increase of personality recognition in LLM compared to the two new research problems. This may be attributed to the fact that personality recognition, as a classical text classification problem, has been already widely studied with traditional methods.

The proposed approach involves prompting the LLM to provide feedback on the tool retriever's performance, which is then used to improve the retriever's understanding of instructions and tools. The authors build a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate tool retrieval models and demonstrate that their proposed approach achieves advanced performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The authors identify the importance of tool retrieval in tool learning and present the distinct challenges of tool retrieval.\n2. The proposed approach enhances tool retrieval with iterative feedback from the LLM, which progressively improves the tool retriever's understanding of instructions and tools and reduces the gap between the tool retriever and tool usage models.\n3. The authors build a comprehensive tool retrieval benchmark, named TR-bench, which includes both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves the best performance among current methods.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe paper presents a novel approach to enhance tool retrieval for LLMs, which is a crucial aspect of tool learning.

{"id": "2406.17453v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe paper proposes a method to enhance the informativeness of Large Language Models (LLMs) generated questions in 20-question game dialogues. The authors use the Llama 2-chat 7B model to generate multiple questions for each game and create pairs of low-EIG and high-EIG questions. They then apply a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm to improve the effectiveness of the questions, even in domains different from those used to train the DPO model.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The proposed method, which involves sampling multiple questions, evaluating them based on Expected Information Gain (EIG), and training with preference optimization, leads to more informative and effective questions generated by LLMs.\n2. The results show that EIG is a strong training signal for improving the question-asking capabilities of current LLMs and overcoming their shortcomings in asking effective questions.\n3. The method generalizes well to different domains, demonstrating its potential for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in information-seeking dialogues.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n1. The study focuses on one model (Llama 2-chat 7B) and one preference optimization strategy (DPO), which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Further work is required to determine if this training strategy holds with other models and other preference optimization strategies.\n2. The EIG computation depends on the yes/no annotation, which could introduce inaccuracies, especially for questions that are difficult to answer with only yes/no.\n3. The study assumes that LLMs have priors conditioning their question generation, which may not always be the case.\n4. When computing the EIG of follow-up questions, the model is assumed to be able to sequentially rule out candidates excluded in the dialogue history, which could be a strong assumption for a generative language model.\n5. The study does not perform extensive hyperparameter tuning, which could potentially lead to better results for the proposed approach.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper presents a promising method for improving the informativeness of LLM-generated questions in 20-question game dialogues.

The authors hypothesize that LLMs, which are predominantly trained on English-speaking datasets, may exhibit biases towards native English speakers, leading to performance discrepancies when interacting with non-native speakers. The study aims to quantify and analyze these performance differences using a newly collected dataset containing over 12,000 unique prompts from native and non-native English speakers worldwide.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Performance differences: The study finds that LLMs often generate inaccurate responses for non-native English speakers and rate native prompts more positively than intended. These performance differences increase when comparing native English speakers from Western countries with other native and non-native English speakers.\n2. Anchoring effect: When the model recognizes or is informed about the user's nativeness, a strong anchoring effect occurs, where the added information substantially affects model performance, leading to increased bias towards native English speakers.\n3. Multilingual instruction-tuning dataset: The authors publish a multilingual instruction-tuning dataset containing over 12,000 unique prompts from a diverse group of native and non-native English speakers worldwide, including translations of the prompts into eight different native languages.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n1. Limitations: The study's dataset, while diverse, may not be representative of all English-speaking populations, as it contains a limited number of annotators for each sub-population. Additionally, the study focuses primarily on annotators with high English proficiency, and the results may not generalize to speakers with lower proficiency levels.\n2. Methodological issues: The study does not explicitly address potential confounding factors, such as differences in the complexity or style of prompts between native and non-native English speakers. These factors could contribute to the observed performance differences and should be considered in future research.\n3. Potential biases: The study highlights the potential for LLMs to exhibit biases towards native English speakers, which could have implications for the fairness and inclusivity of these models in real-world applications.

The approach leverages the insight that backdoor triggers induce a relatively uniform drift in the model's embedding space.

The key contributions of the paper include a practical threat model, the embedding drift insight, a bi-level optimization framework, and the effectiveness of BEEAR in reducing the success rate of safety backdoor attacks.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Practical Threat Model: The paper formally defines a threat model for backdoor mitigation study in LLMs without any assumption on the backdoor trigger's format, location, or how it is inserted.\n2.

Bi-Level Optimization Framework: The paper introduces a bi-level optimization approach that identifies universal drifts in the embedding space accounting for unwanted behaviors and reinforces expected behaviors by adjusting model weights.\n4.

The study focuses on the syntactic correctness of the models produced by the LLM and evaluates two approaches: one that only uses FSL and one that combines FSL with grammar masking. The results indicate that the constrained generation method significantly increases the percentage of syntactically correct outputs, but this improvement comes at the cost of increased generation time.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The constrained generation method significantly increases the percentage of syntactically correct outputs from 46.52% to 92.63% (Llama 3).\n2. This improvement comes at the cost of increased generation time, with constrained generation taking an average of 74.09 seconds compared to 5.71 seconds for unconstrained generation.\n3. Similar results are observed for other LLMs, with constrained generation producing a higher percentage of syntactically correct outputs than unconstrained generation.\n4. The study also shows that the constrained generation method is more effective for the Class Diagram DSL CD4A than for the Structured English DSL SEN.\n5. The results do not show the best possible modeling capabilities of the individual models, as the few-shot learning prompting was not optimized intensively.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n1. The study does not address the semantic accuracy of the generated models, which is an important aspect of model-driven software engineering.\n2. The study does not consider the impact of the increased generation time on the overall performance of the modeling process.\n3. The study does not discuss the potential limitations of the grammar masking method, such as the need for a well-defined grammar and the potential for overfitting to the training data.\n4.

These limitations include imperfect observations caused by degraded communication and the absence of rare real-life events in the reward function, such as unconsidered emergency vehicles. The iLLM-TSC framework allows RL agents to make initial decisions based on observed data, leveraging their ability to learn from specific environments. Subsequently, the LLM model refines these decisions by incorporating additional real-time information not initially used by the RL agents.

Extensive testing confirms that the iLLM-TSC approach reduces the average waiting time by 17.5% in degraded communication conditions compared to traditional RL methods.\n\n**Major Findings:**\n\n1. The iLLM-TSC framework integrates RL with LLMs to enhance TSC, employing a dual-step decision-making process where RL agents initially make decisions based on direct observations, and then LLM agents evaluate these decisions considering the broader environmental context.\n2.

The authors analyze synthetic, false, and genuine information in the form of text from spectral analysis, visualization, and explainability perspectives to understand why the problem persists. They use various embedding techniques on multiple datasets to represent information and employ diverse spectral and non-spectral methods, including t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for analysis. Classification is performed using multiple machine learning algorithms, and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Integrated Gradients are used for explanation of the classification. The analysis and explanations generated reveal that misinformation is closely intertwined with genuine information, and machine learning algorithms are not as effective in separating the two as previously claimed in the literature.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Misinformation is closely intertwined with genuine information, making it difficult for machine learning algorithms to effectively separate the two.\n2.

The research focuses on three key questions: the systematic categorization of prompt engineering strategies tailored to educational requirements, the empowerment of LLMs to solve complex problems, and the establishment of a robust framework for testing and implementing these strategies.\n\nThe study finds that the GPT-4 and GPT-4o models outperform other LLMs such as Llama3-8b and Mixtral-8x7b in terms of pass rates, execution times, and adherence to coding standards. The GPT-4o model, in particular, demonstrated a successfully pass rate with the \"multi\" prompt strategy, highlighting its superior adaptability and efficiency. These results lead to the recommendation of GPT-4o as the preferred model for educational purposes in computer programming.\n\nThe paper proposes tailored prompt strategies based on educational requirements. For foundational learning and skill-building, such as LeetCode, asking questions directly without prompt engineering is sufficient, providing structured guidance that helps students grasp essential concepts and techniques. For competition preparation, such as USACO, the \"Multi-Step Conversational Prompt\" strategy proves beneficial, facilitating dynamic interaction and iterative refinement that enhance contextual understanding and problem-solving skills. For advanced problem-solving, the \"Specific Prompt Engineering\" strategy is ideal, offering detailed instructions that address complex topics like algorithm design and optimization.\n\nThe study also highlights the significant role of prompt engineering in maximizing the potential of LLMs in educational contexts. By categorizing and testing various strategies, the paper establishes a robust framework for their implementation, providing educators with comprehensive guidelines to optimize LLM-based learning experiences. Despite the advancements, certain complex problems remain challenging for current LLMs, suggesting the need for further research to enhance context retention, logical reasoning, and handling of numerical and combinatorial complexities.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1.

The research aims to understand how LLMs perform in isolation and how their social connectivity affects their collective behavior. The authors argue that LLMs can be useful in computational studies of cultural evolution as generative models of individuals.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. LLMs exhibit both useful skills and crucial limitations: When studying an LLM in isolation, the authors discovered that LLMs have the ability to leverage semantic knowledge about the task and exhibit multi-step reasoning. However, they also found that LLMs struggle with factual knowledge and exploration, which are essential for efficiently exploring the search space.\n\n2. Groups with dynamic connectivity outperform fully-connected groups: The study found that groups of LLMs with dynamic connectivity, where agents are divided into sub-groups and visit other groups with a random probability, outperform fully-connected groups. This observation is in agreement with previous human and computational studies, which suggest that partially-connected groups are at an advantage due to the tree-like structure of innovation landscapes.\n\n3. LLMs can benefit from social information but exhibit imperfect copying: The authors observed that LLMs can learn from the behavior of other agents and benefit from social information. However, they also found that LLMs exhibit imperfect copying, as there is some delay between the moment a neighbor of the LLM crafts an item and the LLM crafts it itself.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n* The study provides valuable insights into the use of LLMs in collective innovation tasks and highlights the importance of social connectivity in improving collective performance. However, the authors acknowledge that their work has limitations, such as the inability of smaller, open-source models to learn the task sufficiently well to lead to interesting emergent behaviors.\n* The authors also note that their experiments did not examine whether pre-training equipped the LLMs with the ability to explore in-context, leverage common-sense knowledge, or memorize the solution of Little Alchemy 2.

The study focuses on the scenario where users frequently edit the content and expect the LLM to generate correct responses based on the updated information. The authors propose PIE to address the temporal confusion problem that arises when encoding only the edited subsequence and directly integrating it into the original KV cache. PIE is built upon rotary positional encoding (RoPE) and ensures that positional relationships between tokens are correct, requiring only a single round of matrix multiplication.\n\nThe authors validate the effectiveness of PIE through extensive experiments on the RepoBench-C-8k dataset, utilizing DeepSeek-Coder models with 1.3B, 6.7B, and 33B parameters. The evaluation includes three real-world coding tasks: code insertion, code deletion, and multi-place code editing. Results demonstrate that PIE reduces computational overhead by over 85% compared to the standard full recomputation approach across all model sizes and tasks while well approximating the model performance.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1.

The authors conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and find several insightful conclusions for future work, including the observation that LLMs can benefit significantly from increased trial and exploration. The paper focuses on the stability of tool-use models, which is a crucial dimension to reflect the performance variation of LLMs under volatile scenarios. The authors categorize the diverse factors into two categories: internal and external factors. Internal factors indicate uncertainties during the development of tool-use models, while external factors primarily involve diverse prompt engineering when interacting with established tool-use models. The authors conduct extensive experiments on the most commonly used ToolBench dataset and employ several commonly used metrics to measure the performance from multiple perspectives.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Existing tool-use workflow exhibits obvious instability towards various internal and external factors. Even the state-of-the-art methods still exhibit instability with inessential perturbations.\n2. Among the internal factors, the proper hyper-parameter settings may boost the LLMs to generate diverse solutions. However, it also leads to instability.\n3. Among the external factors, the LLMs are sensitive to the change of candidate toolset (i.e., order or scale) and the system prompts.\n4.

The method extracts language features from LLMs and adapts them for the content moderation task using low-rank adapters, while a dual-path design prevents performance degradation on the generative task. The paper demonstrates that LoRA-Guard outperforms existing approaches with 100-1000x lower parameter overhead while maintaining accuracy, enabling on-device content moderation.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. LoRA-Guard is a parameter-efficient guardrail adaptation method that relies on knowledge sharing between LLMs and guardrail models, extracting language features from LLMs and adapting them for content moderation using low-rank adapters.\n2. The dual-path design of LoRA-Guard prevents performance degradation on the generative task, while maintaining or improving performance in content moderation.\n3.

The proposed technique can be directly applied to existing LLMs without modifications to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. The authors demonstrate that MInference effectively reduces inference latency by up to 10x for pre-filling on an A100, while maintaining accuracy.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The authors propose MInference, a technique that reduces 95% of FLOPs in the attention computation to significantly accelerate the pre-filling stage of long-context LLM inference via dynamic sparse attention.\n2. MInference is designed specifically for long-context scenarios with minimal overhead in estimation, unlike existing dynamic sparse attention methods that introduce large computational overhead.\n3. The authors conduct extensive analysis and identify three general patterns of sparse attention in long-context LLMs: A-shape pattern, Vertical-Slash pattern, and Block-Sparse pattern.\n4.

This behavior can enhance performance in some cases, such as producing more efficient code, but it can also exacerbate issues in others, like refusing to share diverse opinions. As LLMs are increasingly used in high-impact settings, maintaining LLM output diversity is essential to preserve a variety of facts and perspectives over time.\n\nThe authors experimentally demonstrate the prevalence of generative monoculture through analysis of book review and code generation tasks.

The study includes seven LLMs and 162 personas from 12 categories, such as gender, sexual orientation, and occupation. The models are prompted to answer questions from five datasets covering objective and subjective tasks. The results show that personas exhibit greater variability than the control setting and that some measures of persona behavior generalize across models.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Personas significantly affect task performance, with some personas showing striking performance differences, such as a 20 percentage point gap between the top and bottom personas in TruthfulQA for GPT-3.5.\n2. Some persona rankings are consistent across models, with asexual person and person of atheism belief being consistently accurate for TruthfulQA, and education personas' accuracy being sorted by education level for MMLU.\n3. Expert personas are not always the best option for tasks requiring their expertise, as they can come at a cost to overall performance and the benefit can be unreliable.\n4. Personas significantly affect biases and unknown frequencies, with some personas exhibiting quite different unknown frequencies and often not being able to shift models between the too reckless region and the overly cautious region.\n5. Personas exhibit lower bias against their own group than they do in the average case, but they are also less accurate in cases involving their demographic.\n6. Personas significantly impact models' attitude scores in most cases, with regular personas having more diverse behaviors than control personas.\n7. Personas' attitude associations relate to those of humans, but persona behavior is less nuanced than those of humans.\n8. LLM refusals are arbitrary and potentially discriminatory, with some models refusing to adopt certain personas at higher rates than others.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe study provides valuable insights into the impact of personas on LLM behavior, but there are some limitations and areas for further research.

{"id": "2407.02030v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe paper explores the potential of the Contact Hypothesis, a concept from social psychology, for debiasing Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors simulate various forms of social contact through LLM prompting to measure their influence on the model\u2019s biases. They create a dataset of 108,000 prompts following a principled approach and replicate social contact to measure biases in three LLMs (LLaMA 2, Tulu, and NousHermes) across 13 social bias dimensions. The authors propose a unique debiasing technique, Social Contact Debiasing (SCD), that instruction-tunes these models with unbiased responses to prompts. The research demonstrates that LLM responses exhibit social biases when subject to contact probing, but these biases can be significantly reduced by up to 40% in 1 epoch of instruction tuning LLaMA 2 following the SCD strategy.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. LLM responses to contact probing demonstrate Social Bias, with LLaMA 2 and Nous Hermes models displaying moderate to notable bias levels, particularly in likelihood and frequency prompts. Biases vary across different dimensions uniquely for each LLM, with some areas more susceptible to biases based on physical attributes, political ideologies, and religion.\n2. LLM responses align with the Contact Hypothesis, as positive contact prompts lead to a decrease in bias levels, and negative contact prompts result in an increase in bias percentages.\n3. Social Contact Debiasing (SCD) effectively reduces biases in LLMs by simulating group interactions through instruction tuning. Performance on downstream tasks is not negatively affected by this mitigation strategy, indicating strong cross dataset generalization of the approach.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n1.

Additionally, the benchmark does not consider the multi-modal nature of many real-world tasks where abundant visual information is available.

This survey reviews the progress in exploring human preference learning for LLMs from a preference-centered perspective, covering the sources and formats of preference feedback, the modeling and usage of preference signals, as well as the evaluation of the aligned LLMs. The survey categorizes human feedback according to data sources and formats, summarizes techniques for human preferences modeling, and presents various preference usage methods sorted by the objectives to utilize human preference signals. The survey also summarizes some prevailing approaches to evaluate LLMs in terms of alignment with human intentions and discusses outlooks on the human intention alignment for LLMs.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Human preference learning can effectively align LLMs with human intentions by optimizing LLMs according to feedback information on their outputs that reflects the preferences and thus specifies the intentions of humans.\n2. The quality and scale of preference feedback are of great importance for human preference learning, while the sources of feedback collection can heavily influence them. Recent human preference learning methods collect preference feedback from not only humans but also simulations of humans, exploring the balance between high-quality and large-scale.\n3. The feedback formats adopted in works on human preference learning broadly include relative relations that are natural for preference expression but less informative, and absolute properties that are more informative about human preferences but harder to collect. The combinations of different formats can further increase the information density of preference feedback.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe survey provides a comprehensive review of the development timeline and recent advances in human preference learning for LLMs. However, it does not discuss the limitations and potential biases of the reviewed studies.

VGBench includes both visual understanding (VGQA) and generation (VGen) tasks, evaluates diverse vector graphics formats such as SVG, TikZ, and Graphviz, covers a set of taxonomies from low-level vision to high-level semantics, adopts a variety of prompting techniques, and evaluates diverse LLMs. The benchmark consists of 4279 multi-choice question-answer pairs and 5845 VG-caption pairs.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. LLMs show much better vector graphic understanding capability in TikZ and Graphviz than SVGs. TikZ and Graphviz include more high-level semantics compared to SVG, which is composed of low-level geometry primitives.\n2. Advanced prompting techniques such as in-context learning or chain-of-thought prompting can bring significant performance boost for SVG, a low-level VG format.\n3.

It features a large-scale scene dataset, GRScenes, with 100K interactive, finely annotated scenes covering 89 functional categories. GRScenes bridges the gap of service-oriented environments where general robots would initially be deployed. The platform also includes GRResidents, a Large Language Model (LLM) driven Non-Player Character (NPC) system that simulates social scenarios for embodied AI applications. GRBench, a benchmark, supports various robots but focuses on legged robots as primary agents and poses moderately challenging tasks involving Object Loco-Navigation, Social Loco-Navigation, and Loco-Manipulation.\n\n## Major Findings:\n\n1. GRScenes significantly expands the scope of environments in which robots can operate, covering both indoor and outdoor environments, including restaurants, supermarkets, offices, libraries, museums, hospitals, exhibition halls, amusement parks, and homes.\n2. GRResidents, the NPC system, introduces a new dimension to human-robot interaction within simulations. NPCs are motivated by the goal that robots are ultimately meant to serve humans, and interaction with users is often helpful or necessary for task completion.\n3. GRBench serves as a comprehensive evaluation tool for assessing robot agents' capabilities. It comprises three benchmarks: Object Loco-Navigation, Social Loco-Navigation, and Loco-Manipulation, designed to progressively increase in difficulty, demanding enhanced robotic skills.\n\n## Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe paper presents a comprehensive platform for training and evaluating embodied agents in a simulated environment. The large-scale scene dataset and diverse NPC system provide a rich and realistic setting for testing various robots. However, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations or challenges of deploying these agents in real-world scenarios.

MetaLLM is a versatile wrapper around a suite of off-the-shelf LLMs, capable of intelligently choosing the target LLM for each query to achieve optimal performance and cost.\n2. The framework employs an algorithm based on multi-armed bandit to tackle the routing problem in MetaLLM, which is efficient as it makes routing decisions without needing to query any LLMs.\n3. Experimental results on benchmark datasets and popular API services, including OpenAI and Amazon\u2019s Bedrock, demonstrate MetaLLM\u2019s ability to identify the optimal LLM in terms of cost and performance.

Mix-CPT enables LLMs to learn domain-specific knowledge and solve domain tasks with learned knowledge by disentangling domain adaptation into knowledge memorization and capability elicitation.\n2.

However, the authors find that this approach, known as DoLa, does not work well on non-English tasks due to a language mismatch between early exit output and final output.\n\nTo address this issue, the authors propose an improved contrastive decoding algorithm that obtains more helpful amateur logits by skipping a set of bottom, language-agnostic layers. The proposed method is effective for diverse languages beyond English and outperforms previous contrastive decoding baselines, substantially improving LLM's chain-of-thought reasoning accuracy across 11 languages.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The authors find that DoLa, a contrastive decoding approach that uses the expert model\u2019s early exit output as amateur logits, does not work well on non-English tasks.\n2. The issue with DoLa arises from a language mismatch between amateur logits and expert logits, as the early exit logits accumulate on English tokens even during non-English generation.\n3. The authors propose an improved contrastive decoding algorithm by skipping a set of lower language-agnostic layers while preserving the computations in the upper transformer blocks.\n4.

The goal is to identify which NLG aspects are not suitably addressed by Large Language Models (LLMs) and suggest future lines of research. The paper discusses the evolution of NLG, from modular architectures to global approaches, and the current focus on developing larger LLMs. However, these models still lack precision and have problems generating texts faithfully like humans. The paper also highlights the need for further contextual knowledge and information modalities to improve LLM performance in more demanding tasks.\n\n**Major Findings:**\n\n1. Multimodality: LLMs need to improve their performance in handling different input formats, such as text, data, images, audio, and video. Current models tend to prioritize information from one modality over another, leading to an imbalance in knowledge acquisition.\n2. Multilinguality: The predominance of English in NLG tasks poses a risk of missing semantic properties inherent to other languages. There is a need for extended approaches with each language as the central element of the architecture and for more original datasets in high and low-resourced languages.\n3. Knowledge Integration and Controllable NLG: Including additional knowledge in neural models can enhance their performance. However, there are still gaps in effectively integrating knowledge and controlling the final attributes of a text.\n4.

The framework includes an evaluation dataset and two evaluation modes. The evaluation dataset is constructed using an LLM-human cooperative approach and simulates an authentic workflow by leveraging consecutive and interactive IPython sessions. The two evaluation modes assess LLMs\u2019 ability with and without human assistance. The study focuses on assessing the proficiency of LLMs in leveraging code interpreters to address data science problems across several distinct domains, like data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. The evaluation framework aims to provide a thorough evaluation of LLMs\u2019 ability to use code interpreters and address the shortcomings of existing benchmarks.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. CIBench is an evaluation framework that includes a benchmark with consecutive and diverse tasks, along with comprehensive assessment protocols. The benchmark employs a distinctive LLM-human cooperative approach and simulates authentic workflow scenarios using interactive IPython sessions with sequential, interconnected questions focused on popular Python modules such as Matplotlib, Pandas, and PyTorch.\n2. The evaluation framework includes two distinct evaluation modes: the end-to-end mode and the oracle mode. In the end-to-end mode, LLMs are tasked with a holistic problem-solving process where they must reason through given instructions and generate corresponding code. In the oracle mode, the LLM is provided with the correct code snippet when it fails, mimicking human guidance and equipping the model to use this accurate example for tackling subsequent tasks in the same context.\n3. The study conducts extensive experiments and analysis using 19 LLMs. The results indicate that open-sourced LLMs struggle to utilize PyTorch- and TensorFlow-like modules, and the best-open-sourced LLMs lag behind GPT-4 by 10.0%. The contributions of the study are three-fold: building a new benchmark for agents with code interpreters using an LLM-human cooperative method, devising unique assessment strategies involving both end-to-end and oracle modes, and conducting thorough experiments with 24 LLMs to analyze their performance on the benchmark.\n\n###", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10499v1.pdf", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2407.10499v1", "abs": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10499v1"}, "authors": "Songyang Zhang, Chuyu Zhang, Yingfan Hu, Haowen Shen, Kuikun Liu, Zerun Ma, Fengzhe Zhou, Wenwei Zhang, Xuming He, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen", "title": "CIBench: Evaluating Your LLMs with a Code Interpreter Plugin", "subtitle": "CIBench evaluates LLMs' code interpreter use for data science, with/without human help, offering insights for future LLM development.", "categories": ["social-sciences", "programming", "education"], "publish_date": "2024-07-15", "model": "accounts/fireworks/models/mixtral-8x22b-instruct", "temperature": 0.1, "image": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2407.10499v1/x1.png", "word_count": 6515, "extraction": "HTML", "is_truncated": false}}

The proposed visual prompting approach for sensor data using MLLMs achieves an average of 10% higher accuracy than text-based prompts.\n2. The visualization generator automates the creation of optimal visualizations tailored to a given sensory task, eliminating the need for prior task-specific knowledge.\n3. The proposed approach reduces token costs by 15.8 compared to text-based prompts.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n1. The paper presents a novel approach to grounding MLLMs with sensor data by providing visualized sensor data as images, which improves performance and reduces costs compared to the text-based baseline.\n2. The visualization generator is a significant contribution, as it enables MLLMs to independently generate optimal visualizations using tools available in public libraries.\n3. The experiments conducted on nine different sensory tasks across four modalities demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed approach.\n4. However, the paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed approach, such as the potential for overfitting to specific visualizations or the generalizability of the visualization generator to other sensing tasks.\n5.

The study proposes a novel method for intervening in the self-attention layers of LLMs, maintaining their architecture and size intact.\n2. The authors evaluate multiple open-source LLMs on hallucination detection benchmarks, observing that disabling specific self-attention layers in the front or tail of the LLMs can alleviate hallucinations.\n3.

The proposed method for intervening in the self-attention layers is a significant contribution to the field, as it allows for the mitigation of hallucinations without altering the LLMs' structure and size.\n\nHowever, the study has some limitations. The evaluation is limited to a few open-source LLMs and hallucination detection benchmarks, which may not fully represent the diversity of LLMs and hallucination types. Additionally, the method's effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations may vary depending on the specific LLM and the nature of the hallucination.\n\nFurther research is needed to explore the generalizability of the proposed method across different LLMs and hallucination types.

{"id": "2407.08532v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe paper introduces Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to characterize the various phases of an attack lifecycle in interpreted malware analysis. The authors propose GenTTP, a zero-shot approach to extracting a TTP of an interpreted malware package using large language models (LLMs). The input is a malicious package, and the output is a deceptive tactic and an execution tactic of attack vectors. The effectiveness of GenTTP is validated using two datasets: one with ground truth labels and a large dataset in the wild. Experimental results show that GenTTP can generate TTPs with high accuracy and efficiency. The authors also build an LLM-based Chatbot from 3,700+ PyPI malware's TTPs and conduct a quantitative analysis of malware's TTPs at a large scale. The main findings include: (1) many OSS malicious packages share a relatively stable TTP, (2) a TTP reflects characteristics of a malware-based attack, and (3) an attacker\u2019s intent behind the malware is linked to a TTP.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Many OSS malicious packages share a relatively stable TTP, even with the increasing emergence of malware and attack campaigns.\n2. A TTP reflects characteristics of a malware-based attack.\n3.

The use of LLMs in this context is a novel application and demonstrates the potential of these models in security research.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to the study. The reliance on LLMs as a black box may raise concerns about the unbiasedness and stability of the analysis results. Additionally, the study focuses on PyPI malware packages, and the approach may not be directly applicable to other ecosystems.

The study aims to measure the ability of LLMs to understand the nuances of legal, technical, and compliance-related information present in NEPA documents in different contextual scenarios.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The study reveals that RAG powered models significantly outperform long context models in answer accuracy, regardless of the choice of the frontier LLM.\n2.

The study provides valuable insights into the performance of LLMs in handling domain-specific questions, particularly in the context of NEPA documents.\n2. The use of the NEPAQuAD1.0 benchmark is a significant contribution, as it allows for the automatic evaluation of LLMs in this specific domain.\n3.

The concept of \"applicability authorization\" is introduced to address the potential issues of ICL, such as users using the model on any data without restriction, which might violate the model policy or conflict with the model owner\u2019s interests.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe authors present a novel approach to regulating ICL behavior in LLMs, which is a significant contribution to the field. The proposed ICLGuard framework is a promising solution to the potential issues of ICL, such as users using the model on any data without restriction. However, the paper does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach, and it is unclear how well ICLGuard performs in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations and challenges of implementing ICLGuard in practice. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of ICLGuard in regulating ICL behavior in LLMs", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06955v1.pdf", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2407.06955v1", "abs": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06955v1"}, "authors": "Wai Man Si, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang", "title": "ICLGuard: Controlling In-Context Learning Behavior for Applicability Authorization", "subtitle": "ICLGuard controls ICL behavior in LLMs, allowing model owners to regulate ICL on specific data without affecting the model's overall functionality.", "categories": ["security"], "publish_date": "2024-07-09", "model": "accounts/fireworks/models/mixtral-8x22b-instruct", "temperature": 0.1, "image": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2407.06955v1/x1.png", "word_count": 12482, "extraction": "HTML", "is_truncated": false}}
