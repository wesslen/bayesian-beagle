### Summary

**Self-Contrast: Better Reflection Through Inconsistent Solving Perspectives**

**1. Major Findings**
- **Intrinsic Reflection Deficiencies**: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with self-correction due to ineffective intrinsic reflection.
- **Overconfident and Inconsistent Feedback**: LLMs often exhibit overconfidence (46.7%) or inconsistency (45.7%) when self-evaluating, hindering accurate self-reflection.
- **Self-Contrast Approach**: The Self-Contrast method, which involves creating diverse solving perspectives and contrasting the differences, significantly improves LLMs' reflection capabilities across reasoning and translation tasks.

**2. Evaluation of Intrinsic Reflection**
- **Limited Reflection Capability**: LLMs show insignificant performance gains from reflection and struggle to correct incorrect initial responses.
- **Feedback Analysis**: The self-evaluate process results in overconfident and inconsistent feedback, impeding effective reflection.

**3. Self-Contrast**
- **Create Diverse Perspectives**: LLMs autonomously generate multiple prompts tailored to the user's request, fostering diverse solving perspectives.
- **Contrast Inter-Perspective Discrepancies**: LLM contrasts the differences between responses, identifying errors and providing re-examining instructions.
- **Eliminate Discrepancies**: Discrepancies between perspectives guide LLMs to revise inconsistent responses for more accurate reflection.

### Critique
The paper presents a novel approach, but it may benefit from a discussion on potential limitations and challenges in implementing the Self-Contrast method. Additionally, further exploration of real-world application and scalability would enhance the paper's practical significance. Moreover, a comparison with existing state-of-the-art reflection strategies could provide a better understanding of the method's effectiveness.
