### Summary:

The paper introduces a novel multi-target scenario for deployment of draft models for faster inference and presents a more efficient sorted speculative decoding mechanism that outperforms regular baselines in multi-target settings. The proposed method, Sorted Speculative Decoding (S2D), trains multiple draft models in one model to serve more than one target model at a time, addressing the search problem and minimizing training requirements. The method was evaluated on Spec-Bench with base models such as Vicuna 7B, 13B, and LLama Chat 70B, and the results suggest that the draft models perform better than baselines for multiple target models simultaneously.

### Major Findings:

1. The paper introduces a novel multi-target scenario for deployment of draft models for faster inference.
2. A more efficient sorted speculative decoding mechanism, S2D, is presented that outperforms regular baselines in multi-target settings.
3. S2D trains multiple draft models in one model to serve more than one target model at a time, addressing the search problem and minimizing training requirements.
4. The method was evaluated on Spec-Bench with base models such as Vicuna 7B, 13B, and LLama Chat 70B, and the results suggest that the draft models perform better than baselines for multiple target models simultaneously.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents an innovative approach to address the challenges of deploying draft models for faster inference in multi-target scenarios. The proposed S2D method effectively trains multiple draft models in one model, reducing deployment complexity and costs. The evaluation of the method on Spec-Bench with various base models demonstrates its superior performance compared to regular baselines.

However, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations or shortcomings of the proposed method. It would be beneficial to explore the method's performance in scenarios with a larger number of target models or with target models of varying sizes. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the proposed method with other existing approaches for multi-target deployment of draft models.

Overall, the paper presents a promising approach to address the challenges of deploying draft models for faster inference in multi-target scenarios. The proposed S2D method demonstrates superior performance compared to regular baselines,
