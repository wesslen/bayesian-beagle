### Summary:

This work proposes a client-centered approach to assessing LLM (Large Language Model) therapists, called ClientCAST. The approach involves using LLMs to simulate clients, who then interact with LLM therapists and complete questionnaires about the interaction. The client-centered assessment results are derived from the completed questionnaires. Through experiments, it is found that LLMs can generally, though not perfectly, simulate clients, and they are able to distinguish high- and low-quality sessions by completing client-centered questionnaires. The work acknowledges that LLMs struggle to achieve perfect simulation and high levels of human trust in the short term, but argues that the imperfect simulation of LLMs can benefit humans in exploring specific tasks.

### Major Findings:

1. LLMs can generally, though not perfectly, simulate clients, and they are able to distinguish high- and low-quality sessions by completing client-centered questionnaires.
2. The performance of LLM therapists is significantly influenced by the underlying LLM, with more powerful LLMs achieving higher and more stable scores.
3. LLM therapists can foster strong connections with clients, achieving comparable scores in terms of therapeutic alliance, but they are disadvantaged in reacting to clientsâ€™ emotions, with lower scores in terms of positivity and smoothness compared to human therapists.

### Analysis and Critique:

The proposed approach to assessing LLM therapists is a novel and promising direction for further analyses and studies. However, there are some limitations and ethical considerations to be aware of. One limitation is the inconsistency in the simulation of human behavior, which is observed in the field of counseling therapy. Neither the simulation of therapists nor clients is perfect, and LLMs face challenges in accurately simulating the personalities of human clients. However, more powerful LLMs can achieve higher simulation consistency and accuracy. Additionally, different LLMs exhibit inconsistency in various ways, which can be leveraged to simulate characters with diverse features.

In terms of ethical considerations, this work does not advocate for the use of LLMs in therapy, but rather proposes an assessment approach to reveal the characteristics of LLM therapists. The use of LLMs as supplementary tools can inspire human exploration and facilitate further research in AI psychology and sociology. The
