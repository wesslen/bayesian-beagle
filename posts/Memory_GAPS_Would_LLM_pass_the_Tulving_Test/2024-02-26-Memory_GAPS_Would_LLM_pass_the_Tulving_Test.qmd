### **Summary:**
- The article investigates whether the "Synergistic Ecphory Model" of memory and similar RK paradigms are relevant to Large Language Models (LLMs) in acts of remembering.
- It explores the applicability of the General Abstract Processing System (GAPS) framework to LLMs and the possible transpositions of engram and ecphoric information into the domain of generative AI.
- The study presents the results of the Tulving Test of direct comparison between recognition and recall tasks in LLMs, comparing their memory performance to that of human subjects.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The GAPS framework and the Transformer architecture of neural networks at the core of LLMs have similarities in terms of encoding and retrieval processes.
2. The memory performance of LLMs in the Tulving Test of direct comparison is generally comparable to human memory performance, with significant differentiation in the immediate recognition test and the delayed recall test, particularly when prompted with copy cues or ordinal cues.
3. The effects of associative cues (non-copy cues) and the role of retrieval information in LLMs may differ from human memory ecphory, suggesting a different balance in the usage of semantic information and cue/retrieval information in delayed recall of episodic memories in LLMs and human subjects.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The study provides valuable insights into the applicability of the GAPS framework to LLMs and the potential differences in memory performance between LLMs and human subjects.
- However, the article lacks a detailed discussion of the limitations of the study, such as the generalizability of the findings to other LLM models and the potential impact of prompt engineering on memory performance.
- Further research is required to quantitatively assess the variant ecphory processes in human subjects and LLMs, specifically focusing on the analytical definition of Tulving's cue valence based on the general probability distributions learned by LLMs in pretraining.
