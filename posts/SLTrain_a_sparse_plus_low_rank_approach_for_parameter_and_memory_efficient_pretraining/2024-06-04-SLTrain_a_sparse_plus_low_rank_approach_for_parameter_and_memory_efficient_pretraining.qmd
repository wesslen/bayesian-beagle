### Summary:

The paper proposes a novel approach called SLTrain for parameter and memory efficient pretraining of large language models (LLMs). SLTrain combines low-rank and sparse structures to learn models with high representation capacity. The low-rank component is learned via matrix factorization, while the sparse component is learned by employing a simple strategy of uniformly selecting the sparsity support at random and learning only the non-zero entries with the fixed support. The proposed method significantly enhances pretraining performance when combined with low-rank learning, while adding minimal extra parameters and memory costs compared to pretraining with low-rank parameterization.

### Major Findings:

1. SLTrain achieves comparable performance to full-rank training while maintaining both parameter and memory efficiency.
2. SLTrain can reduce memory requirements by up to 73% when pretraining the LLaMA 7B model.
3. The proposed method can be easily integrated with optimizer-based techniques for further improving memory efficiency.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other low-rank and sparse training methods, which could have strengthened the claims of the proposed method's superiority.
2. The paper does not discuss the potential limitations or shortcomings of the proposed method, such as the impact of the choice of sparsity level on the performance of the model.
3. The paper does not provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method, which could have provided insights into its convergence properties and loss landscape.
4. The paper does not discuss the potential applications of the proposed method beyond LLMs, such as in vision or multi-modal foundation models.
5. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, which could have provided insights into its scalability and efficiency.
