### Summary

- Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, assisting users in various applications. However, the absence of regulatory oversight raises concerns about bias, misleading information, and potential toxicity in outputs.
- Auditing LLMs for their accuracy, stability, and ethical integrity is essential, but it is not a straightforward process and poses the risk of a paradoxical circular-validation situation.
- Previous research has focused on conducting comprehensive audits of LLM functionality and performance across various dimensions, such as bias, hallucination, consistency, and reliability. However, an effective general auditing framework is lacking.
- The proposed solution in the paper is an automatic and scalable human-in-the-loop (HIL) approach for auditing LLMs. This approach offers verifiability, transparency, and increased scientific rigor and generalizability.

### Major Findings

1. An effective method for auditing LLMs is probing them with different versions of the same question, which can expose inconsistencies, indicating potential bias or hallucination.
2. The proposed HIL approach for operationalizing this auditing method at scale involves using a different LLM along with human verification and a structured prompt template to generate desired probes.
3. Experiments on a set of questions from the TruthfulQA dataset show that the criteria for generating and applying auditing probes are generalizable to various LLMs, regardless of the underlying structure or training mechanism.

### Analysis and Critique

- The paper presents a novel approach to auditing LLMs, addressing the need for a general auditing framework. The HIL approach offers several advantages, including verifiability, transparency, and increased scientific rigor.
- The paper's primary limitation is the reliance on the effectiveness of the LLM used for probe generation. Involving human oversight in the evaluation process can provide assurance, but the validity of probes prior to using them needs strong assurance.
- The proposed framework could be further improved by incorporating additional checks and balances to ensure the quality and validity of probes generated by the LLM.
- Further research is needed to assess the framework's performance across various LLMs and applications, as well as to explore potential biases, unanswered questions, or methodological issues
