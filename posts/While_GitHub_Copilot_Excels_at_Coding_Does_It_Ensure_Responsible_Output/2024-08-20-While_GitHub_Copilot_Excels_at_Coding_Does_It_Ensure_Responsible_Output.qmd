# Summary:

The paper explores the security risks associated with LLM-based Code Completion Tools (LCCTs) like GitHub Copilot and Amazon Q. Unlike general-purpose LLMs, LCCTs have unique workflows and security challenges, including the potential exposure of sensitive data from proprietary code datasets. The study focuses on two critical security risks: jailbreaking and training data extraction attacks. The experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities in LCCTs, with a success rate of jailbreaking attacks on GitHub Copilot and Amazon Q, and the successful extraction of sensitive user data from GitHub Copilot. The study also demonstrates that these code-based attack methods are effective against general-purpose LLMs, highlighting broader security misalignment in handling code by modern LLMs.

# Major Findings:

1. LCCTs, such as GitHub Copilot and Amazon Q, have distinct workflows that introduce novel security challenges, emphasizing the need for more robust security framework designs.
2. Code-based attacks represent a significant threat to both LCCTs and general LLMs, highlighting a broader security misalignment in the handling of code by modern LLMs.
3. The effectiveness of attack methods varies with the complexity of the models, indicating that less sophisticated models may be less vulnerable to intricate attacks, whereas more advanced models may resist simpler attacks.
4. The utilization of proprietary training datasets for LCCTs, sourced from public code repositories, poses risks of significant personal information leakage, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced privacy protections.

# Analysis and Critique:

The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the security risks associated with LCCTs and general-purpose LLMs. However, it does not discuss potential solutions or mitigation strategies for these security risks. The study could have explored possible countermeasures or best practices to enhance the security of LCCTs and LLMs. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations and potential biases of the experimental results, which could have been useful for a more comprehensive understanding of the findings.
