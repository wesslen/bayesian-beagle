### Major Takeaways

1. **Augmented Reality (AR) in Healthcare**: The paper explores the potential use of AR in healthcare, specifically for remote medical training and supervision, focusing on the teaching of a complex medical procedure, the placement of a central venous catheter under ultrasound guidance.

2. **AR Teaching Strategies**: The study presents AR design principles and teaching strategies, including visual and non-verbal communication, volumetric data, objects and annotations, gestural communication, and user interface design, tailored for procedural skill training.

3. **Comparison with Video-conferencing**: The paper compares teaching in AR with video conferencing, identifying how visual communication and workload differ between the two mediums, and proposes best practice recommendations for AR teaching.

### Related Work

- The paper reviews existing literature on AR collaboration and AR in healthcare to inform and contextualize the discussion on AR usage for medical training.
- It highlights the importance of spatial user interface and spatial workspace setup for procedural skill training in AR.

### Critique

- While the paper offers valuable insights into the potential use of AR for medical training, it primarily focuses on the design and evaluation of the AR communication system for procedural skill training. It could benefit from a more extensive discussion of the broader implications and limitations of using AR in healthcare training, such as ethical considerations, cost implications, and user acceptance.

- The study primarily focuses on the technical and operational aspects of the AR system, and its impact on the trainees' skill acquisition, with less emphasis on the overall effectiveness and outcomes of AR-based training. More in-depth analysis of the long-term skill retention and cognitive load of trainees in AR vs. traditional training would provide further insights.
