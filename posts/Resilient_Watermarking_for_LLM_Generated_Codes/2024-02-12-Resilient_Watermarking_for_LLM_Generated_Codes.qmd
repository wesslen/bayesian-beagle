### **Summary:**
The article introduces ACW, a novel method for watermarking AI-generated codes. ACW is designed to watermark codes through a series of carefully-designed code transformations and to examine the authenticity and origin of the code in the identification stage. The method is evaluated using multiple LLMs and code prompt datasets, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness, resilience, and ability to preserve the utility of the generated codes.

### **Major Findings:**
1. **Effectiveness of ACW:** ACW achieves high accuracy, true positive rates, and low false positive rates in distinguishing AI-generated codes from human-written ones.
2. **Utility Preservation:** ACW preserves the utility of the AI-generated codes, with minimal impact on the pass rate of the generated codes.
3. **Resilience to Code Modifications:** ACW demonstrates resilience to common code modifications, including distortion and forgery attacks, maintaining its effectiveness in identifying watermarked codes.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The article provides a comprehensive evaluation of ACW, demonstrating its effectiveness, utility preservation, and resilience to code modifications.
- The method's ability to extract watermarks correctly and reliably is a significant strength, as it ensures the accuracy of identifying watermarked codes.
- The experimental results show that ACW outperforms existing methods, indicating its potential for practical applications in watermarking AI-generated codes.

Overall, the article presents a well-structured and coherent evaluation of ACW, highlighting its potential as an effective method for watermarking AI-generated codes. However, further research and real-world applications are needed to validate its performance in diverse scenarios and use cases.
