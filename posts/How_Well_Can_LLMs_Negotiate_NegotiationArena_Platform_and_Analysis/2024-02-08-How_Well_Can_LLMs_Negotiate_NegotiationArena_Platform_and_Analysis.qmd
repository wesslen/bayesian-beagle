### Summary:
- The paper introduces NEGOTIATIONARENA, a framework for evaluating the negotiation abilities of large language model (LLM) agents.
- The authors implemented three types of scenarios in NEGOTIATIONARENA to assess LLM's behaviors in allocating shared resources, aggregate resources, and buy/sell goods.
- LLM agents can significantly boost their negotiation outcomes by employing certain behavioral tactics, such as pretending to be desolate and desperate.
- The paper also quantifies irrational negotiation behaviors exhibited by the LLM agents, many of which also appear in humans.
- The authors propose NEGOTIATIONARENA as a new open-source resource for studying LLM interactions and offer quantitative evaluations of how well LLMs negotiate against each other.

### Major Findings:
1. LLM agents can significantly improve their negotiation outcomes by employing specific behavioral tactics, such as pretending to be desolate and desperate.
2. The study quantifies irrational negotiation behaviors exhibited by LLM agents, many of which also appear in humans.
3. NEGOTIATIONARENA is proposed as a new open-source resource for studying LLM interactions and offers quantitative evaluations of how well LLMs negotiate against each other.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of LLMs in negotiation scenarios, highlighting the impact of turn order, role, and social behaviors on negotiation outcomes.
- The section sheds light on the behavior of LLMs in negotiation games, highlighting the sensitivity of LLMs to the perceived fairness of proposals and the impact of the available amount to split on the final distribution.
- The section offers valuable insights into the experimental details, limitations, and design choices of the negotiation platform, showcasing the diverse behaviors and reasoning exhibited by the LLMs during negotiations.
- Understanding the rules and mechanics of the negotiation game, as well as the available resources and constraints, is essential for effective participation in the negotiation game.
