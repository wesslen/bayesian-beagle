**Summary:**

The article introduces a principle-based teacher-student framework, Teaching via Principle Discovery (TPD), designed to enhance the reasoning abilities of student language models (LLMs). The TPD framework mimics the interaction between a teacher and a student, where the teacher LLM generates problem-solving instructions and corrective principles based on the student LLM’s errors. These principles guide the refinement of instructions and the selection of instructive examples from a validation set, enabling the student model to learn from both the teacher’s guidance and its own mistakes. The TPD framework significantly improves the student model’s performance across eight reasoning tasks compared to standard prompting methods.

### Major Findings:
1. The TPD framework demonstrates a 6.2% improvement in the student model’s performance across eight reasoning tasks.
2. Providing problem-solving instructions and instructive examples significantly enhances the student model's learning from the teacher’s guidance and its own errors.
3. Selecting new examples from practice questions, guided by the principle list, outperforms direct injection of the principle list or the critique-revise method.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article presents a comprehensive approach to enhance the reasoning abilities of student language models, addressing the limitations of standard prompting methods. However, the TPD framework may have limitations in addressing common sense errors and efficiently integrating a long list of principles into student language models. The method for applying principles and the integration of factual knowledge into the model’s parameters during training require further exploration. Additionally, the critique-and-revise method resulted in a decrease in performance, requiring further investigation. Furthermore, the TPD framework’s inability to rectify common sense errors, especially in specific datasets, poses a significant challenge. Finally, the article provides valuable insights into improving reasoning abilities and highlights the need for further research to streamline the integration of principles into student language models.
