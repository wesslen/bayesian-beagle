### Summary:

The article introduces Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) as a method to enhance the generalizability of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning, specifically in math problem-solving. ReFT first conducts Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then employs reinforcement learning using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to further fine-tune the model. This allows the model to learn from multiple annotated reasoning paths given a question, leading to improved generalization. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that ReFT significantly outperforms SFT, without relying on extra or augmented training questions. The article also provides examples of natural language CoT (N-CoT) and program-based CoT (P-CoT) representations from the GSM8K dataset.

### Major Findings:
1. Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) significantly outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in terms of performance and generalization ability.
2. ReFT demonstrates compatibility with techniques such as majority voting and reward model reranking, showcasing its versatility and practical value.
3. The examples of N-CoT and P-CoT representations provide a foundation for training and fine-tuning language models to perform complex reasoning tasks.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article's content is significant as it introduces a novel approach, ReFT, to enhance the generalizability of LLMs for reasoning, particularly in math problem-solving. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various datasets, highlighting its potential for improving performance without relying on additional training questions. The comparison with existing approaches and the examples of N-CoT and P-CoT representations further validate the robustness and effectiveness of ReFT. However, potential limitations or methodological issues are not explicitly addressed in the individual section summaries, and further research may be needed to explore the scalability and applicability of ReFT to other domains beyond math problem-solving.
