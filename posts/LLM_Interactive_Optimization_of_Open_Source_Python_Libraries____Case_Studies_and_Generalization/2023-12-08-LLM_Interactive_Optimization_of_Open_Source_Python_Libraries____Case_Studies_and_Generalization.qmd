### Major Takeaways

1. **LLMs for Code Optimization**: The study showcases the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in optimizing open-source Python libraries by collaborating with human experts. The results demonstrate substantial performance improvements across multiple case studies.

2. **Human Expert in the Loop**: The paper highlights the essential role of human expertise in guiding LLMs to achieve effective solutions, often with fewer iterations than anticipated. The interactive collaboration of human and LLMs leads to significant performance improvements in the optimized code.

3. **Promising Tool for Code Optimization**: The findings indicate a strong potential for the practical utility of LLMs in code optimization in open-source libraries, emphasizing their collaborative dynamics with human experts.

### Introduction

#### Aims
