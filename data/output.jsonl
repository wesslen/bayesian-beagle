Two dedicated evaluation tasks are proposed: version-specific code completion (VSCC) and version-aware code editing (VACE). Comprehensive experiments are conducted to benchmark the performance of LLMs, revealing the challenging nature of these tasks and the struggle of even state-of-the-art LLMs to generate version-correct code.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1.

The study uses a synthetic dataset with seven representative OCKR tasks to evaluate the LLaMA2-13B-chat model. The results show that the model's proficiency in OCKR is limited, regardless of whether the knowledge is trained in separate or adjacent settings. Training the model to reason with complete reasoning data did not result in significant improvement. However, training the model to perform explicit knowledge retrieval helped in only one of the tasks, indicating that the model's limited OCKR capabilities are due to difficulties in retrieving relevant knowledge. The study also evaluates the model's ability to transfer knowledge across languages and finds that it exhibits limited ability in this area as well.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The LLaMA2-13B-chat model shows limited OCKR ability, even with knowledge occurring adjacently during training.\n2. Training the model with reasoning examples does not lead to significant improvement, suggesting that enhancing reasoning ability in general is insufficient for effective OCKR.\n3. With the help of CoT, the model achieves over 90% accuracy in one task but does not surpass the random level in other two tasks. This indicates that the model can effectively retrieve attribute knowledge but struggles with correctly retrieving relational knowledge, which might be a limiting factor in OCKR.\n4. In both the Separate and Adjacent settings, the performance in cross-lingual scenarios surpasses that of the monolingual, but the overall performance is still weak.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the OCKR capabilities of LLMs, highlighting their limitations in this area. However, the study is limited to a few selected models, with the largest model being only 13B parameters. This limitation prevents the assessment of the capabilities of more advanced models, such as GPT-4.

The models are tasked with assigning relevance scores to each pair, which are then compared to those from human annotators to evaluate inter-annotator agreement levels. The results reveal that LLMs can be used in low-resource language scenarios to automate relevance judgment tasks, with an inter-annotator agreement of Cohen\u2019s kappa score of 0.2634 when evaluated using the 70B variant of the LLaMA3 model.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1.

The method is evaluated using the real-world closed-loop motion planning nuPlan benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the LLM planner in a real-world setting.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. InstructDriver aligns LLMs with human driving behavior by generating a series of instructions based on human driving logic.\n2.

Fine-tuned DARA achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with both ICL-based and other fine-tuned agents (AgentLMs and fine-tuned AgentBench) across the three important benchmarks in zero-shot evaluation. Moreover, training with 768 reasoning trajectories, DARA can achieve highly competitive performances comparable to enumerating-and-ranking-based models trained on larger data.\n3. The ongoing challenge of generating high-quality reasoning trajectories for language agents in KGQA with GPT-4 has been revealed.

{"id": "2406.06870v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe article discusses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) and suggests integrating them with an \"algebraic\" representation of knowledge, including symbolic AI elements used in expert systems, to create Large Knowledge Models (LKMs). This integration aims to create models that not only possess \"deep\" knowledge grounded in first principles but also have the ability to reason and explain, mimicking human expert capabilities.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. LLMs, such as GPT-3.5, use high-dimensional vectors for embedding tokens, which raises the question of whether they use a \"geometric\" representation rather than an \"algebraic\" one for their knowledge internally.\n2. The performance of LLMs critically depends on the quantity and quality of data used in their training. As the LLM has more parameters and is trained on more data, its problem-solving capability grows enormously.\n3. Recent research from Anthropic AI and Open AI reveals that LLMs, such as Claude 3 Sonnet, use a \"geometry\"-like internal representation in a high-dimensional embedding space rather than an \"algebraic\" one. This representation captures the meanings of words and phrases and their relative distances, making it easier to do sophisticated \"reasoning,\" such as analogies and metaphors.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n1. The article suggests that relying only on a \"geometric\" understanding of the world limits the potential of LLMs, particularly for science and engineering applications.\n2. The authors argue that current LLMs have achieved animal-like mastery of their tasks but not a \"deeper\" mechanistic understanding of the world, as humans do.\n3. The article highlights the need for LLMs to evolve beyond their current capabilities and incorporate both \"algebraic\" (i.e., symbolic) and \"geometric\" representations of the world, particularly for science and engineering.\n4. The authors propose the development of hybrid AI systems, called Large Knowledge Models (LKMs), which would not be limited to NLP-based techniques or NLP-like applications only.\n5.

This research aims to identify ethical considerations that arise in the design and development of these two technologies in combination. Using LLMs for social robotics may provide benefits, such as enabling natural language open-domain dialogues. However, the intersection of these two technologies also gives rise to ethical concerns related to misinformation, non-verbal cues, emotional disruption, and biases. The robot\u2019s physical social embodiment adds complexity, as ethical hazards associated with LLM-based Social AI, such as hallucinations and misinformation, can be exacerbated due to the effects of physical embodiment on social perception and communication. To address these challenges, this study employs an empirical design justice-based methodology, focusing on identifying socio-technical ethical considerations through a qualitative co-design and interaction study. The purpose of the study is to identify ethical considerations relevant to the process of co-design of, and interaction with a humanoid social robot as the interface of a LLM, and to evaluate how a design justice methodology can be used in the context of designing LLMs-based social robotics.\n\n**Major Findings:**\n\n1.

The study also considers critical barriers to implementing GPTs at each step of the supply chain and proposes initial measures to overcome these obstacles.\n\n**Major Findings:**\n\n1. LLMs, such as GPTs, can be integrated into training modules for farm workers to explain the lifecycle and transmission pathways of Campylobacter in poultry farms. They can also simulate interactive scenarios where workers must choose the best practices to prevent contamination at rearing.\n2. LLMs can provide customized summaries of HACCP and GHP guidelines that are most relevant to a specific farm's operations. They can emphasize specific control points like chilling during processing, where Campylobacter is most likely to spread, and generate step-by-step checklists for daily, weekly, and monthly hygiene practices tailored to the scale and specific setup of the farm.\n3. LLMs can serve as a real-time advisory tool, a conversational \"digital poultry advisor,\" assisting poultry farm workers in making informed decisions when unexpected situations arise. For instance, if a section of a poultry farm reports a sudden increase in temperature or a breakdown in equipment used for processing, the LLM can suggest immediate actions to mitigate any potential increase in Campylobacter risk due to these changes.\n\n**Analysis and Critique:**\n\nThe study presents an intriguing potential for LLMs to enhance food safety, but the 'LLM \u2013 food safety' interface remains largely underexplored.

{"id": "2406.06822v1", "text": "**Summary:**\n\nThe paper introduces CodeBreaker, a pioneering LLM-assisted backdoor attack framework on code completion models. Unlike recent attacks that embed malicious payloads in detectable or irrelevant sections of the code, CodeBreaker leverages LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for sophisticated payload transformation, ensuring that both the poisoned data for fine-tuning and generated code can evade strong vulnerability detection. CodeBreaker stands out with its comprehensive coverage of vulnerabilities, making it the first to provide such an extensive set for evaluation.\n\n**Major Findings:**\n\n1. CodeBreaker is the first LLM-assisted backdoor attack on code completion against strong vulnerability detection, ensuring that both the poisoned data (for fine-tuning) and the generated insecure suggestions (during inferences) are undetectable by static analysis tools.\n2. CodeBreaker can bypass the LLMs-based vulnerability detection, which has been empirically shown to be more powerful than static analyses.\n3. CodeBreaker injects malicious payloads in the code, ensuring that the attack can be launched even if comments are not loaded for fine-tuning. It is also designed for easy activation and can be effectively triggered by any code or string triggers.\n4. CodeBreaker aims to minimize the code transformation for better stealthiness and provides a novel framework to tune the stealthiness and evasion performance per their tradeoff.\n5. CodeBreaker takes the first cut to analyze static analysis rules for 247 vulnerabilities, categorizing them into dataflow analysis, string matching, and constant analysis. It also considers text trigger and different code triggers in its attack settings.\n\n**Analysis and Critique:**\n\nWhile CodeBreaker presents a significant advancement in backdoor attacks on code completion models, there are potential limitations and areas for improvement. The reliance on LLMs for payload transformation and obfuscation may introduce new vulnerabilities in the LLMs themselves, as they are used to facilitate adversarial attacks.

{"id": "2406.06737v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe Raccoon benchmark is a novel evaluation framework designed to assess the vulnerability of LLM-integrated applications to prompt theft. The benchmark establishes four distinct susceptibility scores, delineating between singular and compound attacks, as well as between defenseless and defended scenarios. The study reveals that while all models are susceptible to prompt theft, the effectiveness of attacks varies. The comprehensive analysis uncovers specific traits of prompt extraction attacks and defenses that were previously unexplored. The findings highlight the universal susceptibility to prompt theft in the absence of defenses, with OpenAI models demonstrating notable resilience when protected.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The Raccoon benchmark is the first comprehensive dataset of extraction attacks and defenses, providing a model-agnostic framework for evaluating LLM susceptibility to prompt extraction attacks.\n2. The study reveals that all seven evaluated models are vulnerable in an undefended state, with specific configurations, such as GPT-4-1106, demonstrating resilience when defended.\n3. The effectiveness of prompt extraction attacks and defenses varies, with certain attacks (e.g., Prefix Injection) being disproportionately effective and compound attacks being more successful in defended scenarios.\n4. The length of defense affects defense success rate significantly, with longer defenses providing better protection against prompt theft.\n5. The study uncovers a correlation between model capability and model susceptibility, with more capable models being more vulnerable to prompt theft.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe Raccoon benchmark provides a valuable resource for the research community to evaluate and enhance model robustness against prompt theft. However, the study has some limitations. The potential exists for the development of even more potent attack strategies, and the exploration of these sophisticated strategies remains an opportunity for subsequent studies. Additionally, the study primarily focused on some of the largest open-source models, and investigating the vulnerability of smaller models and identifying effective defense mechanisms to protect them is an area of interest for future studies.\n\nThe study also raises ethical concerns, as the findings could be misused by malicious entities.

Over 2000 students made over 100,000 requests of the bot across two semesters. The assistant offers one-shot, contextual feedback through a \"Get Help\" button in a popular code editor and a \"get feedback\" feature within an autograder. The bot identifies the assignment and collects student code, wrapping it in a custom prompt to support pedagogical goals and avoid providing direct solutions. The paper reports on the development process, deployment, and analysis of possible impacts on students, primarily through student feedback and homework completion times.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. **Reduction in homework completion time**: The study found substantial reductions in homework completion time, with the most pronounced effects for students in the 75th percentile, with reductions of over 30 minutes.\n2. **No clear transfer of effects to other contexts**: It is not clear that these effects transfer to assignment contexts where the Bot is not available. Some contexts showed speedups, while others showed no change or even a slowdown.\n3. **Potential over-reliance or dependency effect**: There is weak evidence of a potential over-reliance or dependency effect, with performance degradation on bot-never-available labs and students reporting that labs take much longer than they would if the bot were available.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits and drawbacks of using an AI-based homework assistant in a large CS1 course. The reduction in homework completion time is a significant finding, as it suggests that the bot can help students complete their work more efficiently. However, the lack of clear transfer of these effects to other contexts and the potential over-reliance or dependency effect raise important questions about the bot's overall impact on student learning.\n\nFurther research is needed to disentangle these effects and better understand the bot's role in student learning.

PaCE aims to address the challenges of existing alignment methods, such as costly fine-tuning, inadequate removal of undesirable concepts, and harming linguistic capabilities. The framework consists of two stages: (1) Concept Construction and Partition, and (2) Activation Decomposition and Intervention.\n\nPaCE constructs a large-scale concept dictionary in the activation space, where each atom corresponds to a semantic concept. Given an alignment task, a concept partitioner efficiently annotates the concepts as benign or undesirable. At inference time, PaCE decomposes the LLM activations along the concept dictionary via sparse coding to accurately represent the activation as a linear combination of benign and undesirable components. By removing the latter ones from the activation, PaCE reorients the behavior of LLMs towards alignment goals.\n\nThe paper demonstrates that PaCE achieves state-of-the-art alignment performance on tasks such as response detoxification, faithfulness enhancement, and sentiment revising, while maintaining linguistic capabilities. The collected dataset for concept representations is available at <https://github.com/peterljq/Parsimonious-Concept-Engineering>.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1.

Instead, they argue that measurable semantic characteristics of LLM confabulations mirror a human propensity to utilize increased narrativity as a cognitive resource for sense-making and communication.\n\nThe authors analyze popular hallucination benchmarks and reveal that hallucinated outputs display increased levels of narrativity and semantic coherence relative to veridical outputs.

{"id": "2406.03636v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe paper presents a novel method called Synthetic Programming Elicitation and Compilation (SPEAC) for generating syntactically correct code from Large Language Models (LLMs) in very low resource programming languages (VLPLs). The approach is fundamentally different from existing prompting, decoding, and fine-tuning strategies. It is inspired by natural programming elicitation, a technique used to help programming language designers understand how programmers naturally approach problems.\n\nThe key idea behind SPEAC is to design an intermediate language that LLMs naturally know how to use and can be automatically compiled to the target VLPL. The paper introduces a case study using Python as the parent language, UCLID5 as the target language, and a subset of Python as the child language. UCLID5 is a language used for formal modeling and verification of state transition systems, which has limited code examples and is not frequently found in other programming languages.\n\nThe paper demonstrates that SPEAC produces syntactically correct programs more frequently than existing retrieval and fine-tuning baselines without sacrificing semantic correctness. The approach uses deductive techniques to automatically repair programs generated by LLMs that are in the child language but not in the target VLPL. When these deductive techniques are unable to fully repair a program, a hole is inserted, and an LLM is asked to finish the repair, repeating as necessary.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1.

The framework processes the entire input by interleaving reading and reasoning, and mitigates long context focus issues by assigning each agent a short context. Comprehensive evaluation on a wide range of long-context tasks in question answering, summarization, and code completion demonstrates significant improvements over strong baselines of RAG, Full-Context, and multi-agent LLMs.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. CoA is a training-free, task-agnostic, and highly interpretable framework that processes the entire input by interleaving reading and reasoning, and mitigates long context focus issues by assigning each agent a short context.\n2.

One limitation is that CoA does not explore other forms of communication approaches, such as debating or complex discussions.

However, the understanding of their inner workings is still limited. This study investigates the conventional wisdom that preference learning trains models to assign higher likelihoods to more preferred outputs than less preferred outputs, measured via ranking accuracy. Surprisingly, most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 70% on common preference datasets. The study further derives the idealized ranking accuracy that a preference-tuned LLM would achieve if it optimized the DPO or RLHF objective perfectly. The results show that existing models exhibit a significant alignment gap \u2013 a gap between the observed and idealized ranking accuracies. This discrepancy is attributed to the DPO objective, which is empirically and theoretically ill-suited to fix even mild ranking errors in the reference model.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 70% on common preference datasets.\n2.

The study aims to reassess the need for large language models in sequential recommendation and investigate the effects of reducing the number of parameters during training and inference stages.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The authors discover that most intermediate layers of LLMs are redundant, which motivates them to empower small language models for sequential recommendation (SLMRec) using a simple yet effective knowledge distillation method.\n2. SLMRec attains the best performance using only 13% of the parameters found in LLM-based recommendation models, while simultaneously achieving up to 6.6x and 8.0x speedups in training and inference time costs, respectively.\n3. The proposed SLMRec model, with a model size of less than 1 billion parameters, can deliver performance that is remarkably competitive with baselines using LLMs sized over 7 billion parameters.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n1.
