### Summary:

The paper presents a case study on domain-specific tool-using agents, focusing on an automated math visualizer and solver system for mathematical pedagogy. The system, called MathViz-E, orchestrates mathematical solvers and math graphing tools to produce accurate visualizations from simple natural language commands. The authors describe the creation of specialized datasets and develop an auto-evaluator to compare system outputs to ground-truth expressions. The main contributions include:

1. A voice-driven automated graphing system for in-classroom math pedagogy, combining an LLM with a mathematical solver and a visual graphing calculator.
2. New domain-specific datasets for graphing problems, aligned with educational standards for middle and high school.
3. An auto-evaluation pipeline for simplifying the evaluation of different versions of the system.
4. Results demonstrating that the proposed system achieves high accuracy on various learning objectives and outperforms an LLM-only system.

### Major Findings:

1. The MathViz-E system combines an LLM with specialized tools to create a robust voice- and dialog-based system for mathematical pedagogy.
2. The system uses chain-of-thought with a general instruction-tuned LLM for multiple purposes, including query reformulation and tool control.
3. The incorporation of multiple tools, including a solver, provides a foundation of accuracy, as LLMs alone are incapable of reliably solving several types of math problems.
4. The system achieves high accuracy on a wide variety of learning objectives and significantly outperforms an LLM-only system.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the MathViz-E system with other existing math visualization tools or systems.
2. The authors do not discuss the potential limitations or biases of the system, such as its performance on complex or multi-step problems.
3. The paper does not address the scalability of the system, including its ability to handle large-scale datasets or real-time processing.
4. The authors do not discuss the potential for integrating the system with other educational technologies or platforms.
5. The paper does not explore the potential for using the system in other domains or applications beyond mathematical pedagogy.
