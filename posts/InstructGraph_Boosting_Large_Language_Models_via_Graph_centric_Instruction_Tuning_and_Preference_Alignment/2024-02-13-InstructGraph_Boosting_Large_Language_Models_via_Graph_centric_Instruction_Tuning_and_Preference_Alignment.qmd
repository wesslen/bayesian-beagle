### **Summary:**
The article proposes InstructGraph, a framework that empowers large language models (LLMs) with the abilities of graph reasoning and generation by instruction tuning and preference alignment. It introduces a structured format verbalizer to unify all graph data into a universal code-like format and a graph instruction tuning stage to guide LLMs in solving graph reasoning and generation tasks. The article also identifies potential hallucination problems in graph tasks and introduces a preference alignment stage to enhance the output's reliability of the model. Extensive experiments across multiple graph-centric tasks exhibit that InstructGraph can achieve the best performance and outperform existing models by a significant margin.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The InstructGraph framework empowers LLMs with the abilities of graph reasoning and generation through instruction tuning and preference alignment.
2. A structured format verbalizer is introduced to unify all graph data into a universal code-like format, simplifying the representation of the graph without external graph-specific encoders.
3. InstructGraph achieves the best performance and outperforms GPT-4 and LLaMA2 by more than 13% and 38%, respectively, across multiple graph-centric tasks.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The article provides a comprehensive framework for empowering LLMs with graph reasoning and generation abilities, addressing the semantic gap between graph and text and reducing the effect of hallucination in graph reasoning and generation.
- The proposed framework demonstrates significant improvements in performance across various graph-centric tasks, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' capabilities.
- The article lacks a detailed discussion of potential limitations or challenges associated with the proposed framework, such as computational complexity, scalability, or generalizability to diverse graph tasks.
- Further research is needed to explore the practical implementation and real-world applications of the InstructGraph framework, as well as its potential impact on the field of natural language processing and graph reasoning.
