### Summary:

The article introduces a novel framework for controlled generation in large language models (LLMs) called Open-domain Implicit Format Control (OIFC). This framework leverages user-provided, one-shot QA pairs to address the limitations of current models in handling open-domain format requirements. The study investigates LLMs' capabilities to follow open-domain, one-shot constraints and replicate the format of example answers. The authors observe that this is a non-trivial problem for current LLMs. They also develop a dataset collection methodology for supervised fine-tuning that enhances the open-domain format control of LLMs without degrading output quality. The resulting datasets, named OIFC-SFT, along with the related code, will be made publicly available.

### Major Findings:

1. The study highlights the need for open-domain format control in LLMs, as current models struggle with this task, even when meticulously prompted.
2. The proposed OIFC framework addresses this issue by utilizing implicit format descriptions derived from one-shot examples provided by users, which allows for the specification of highly complex requirements and bridges the gap between user demands and predefined formats.
3. The authors develop a data collection methodology, resulting in a training dataset and a testing benchmark tailored to the proposed framework. Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), they observe notable improvements in open-domain format control with negligible fluctuations in the helpfulness of model responses.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The study's focus on open-domain format control is timely and relevant, given the increasing use of LLMs in various applications.
2. The proposed OIFC framework and dataset collection methodology have the potential to significantly improve the open-domain format control capabilities of LLMs.
3. However, the study does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the proposed framework with existing methods, which could have strengthened the argument for its superiority.
4. The authors acknowledge that even with the proposed framework, current LLMs still struggle with open-domain format control, suggesting that further research is needed to fully address this challenge.
5. The study's reliance on user-provided, one-shot examples for format control raises questions about the scalability and generalizability of the proposed approach,
