### Summary:

- The Modular Ontology Modeling (MOMo) methodology aims to mimic human analogical process using modular patterns for assembling complex concepts.
- A major bottleneck for large-scale deployment of MOMo is the limited availability of ready-to-use ontology design patterns (ODPs).
- This paper presents a collection of 104 ODPs, organized into a fully-annotated modular ontology design library, curated from common-sense knowledge available in Large Language Models (LLMs).

### Major Findings:
1. The authors created a design library, CS-MODL, composed of commonsense micropatterns, which are na√Øve responses from an LLM about common properties of common nouns, encoded into simple and lightweight RDFS micropatterns.
2. The paper outlines the methodology for obtaining appropriate
