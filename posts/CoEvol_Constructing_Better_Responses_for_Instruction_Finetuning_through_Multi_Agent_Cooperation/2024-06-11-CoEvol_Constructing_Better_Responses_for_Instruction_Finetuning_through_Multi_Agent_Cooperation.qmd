### Summary:

The paper proposes CoEvol, an LLM-based multi-agent cooperation framework for improving the quality of responses in instruction fine-tuning (IFT) data. The framework follows a debate-advise-edit-judge paradigm and employs a two-stage MAD strategy to maximize the diversity of perspectives within debate while minimizing the cost of agents. The proposed framework has been shown to be effective in evolving better IFT data through response augmentation.

### Major Findings:

1. CoEvol is an innovative framework for improving IFT data quality through response enhancement, utilizing a two-stage MAD strategy to maximize the diversity of perspectives within debate while minimizing the cost of agents.
2. The framework follows a debate-advise-edit-judge paradigm, establishing a pipeline to harness the collective power of agents with distinct roles.
3. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of CoEvol in evolving better IFT data through response augmentation.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper focuses on improving the quality of responses in IFT data, which is a significant aspect of enhancing the applicability and generalization capabilities of pre-trained language models.
2. The proposed framework, CoEvol, leverages the potential of LLM-based multi-agents in collaboration to automatically edit responses, generating high-quality data for fine-tuning superior LLMs.
3. The paper's limitations include the use of the same LLM for building multi-agents, which may lead to the accumulation of bias, and the need for further experiments to investigate the impact of agents based on different LLMs.
4. The paper does not explore the potential of the most powerful models like GPT-4 and Claude-3 when equipped with CoEvol, which could be a promising direction for future research.
5. The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed framework, including human evaluations and comparisons with other data augmentation methods.
6. The paper could also provide more detailed examples of data evolution using CoEvol, as well as a more in-depth analysis of the evolving directions and their impact on the quality of IFT data.
