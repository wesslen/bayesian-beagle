# Summary:

The paper proposes a method to evaluate the economic biases of large language models (LLMs) using utility theory, a paradigm at the core of modern economic theory. The authors demonstrate their approach by quantifying and comparing the economic behavior of various open- and closed-source LLMs. The findings reveal that the economic behavior of current LLMs is neither entirely human-like nor entirely economicus-like, and most LLMs struggle to maintain consistent economic behavior across settings. The paper also illustrates how the proposed approach can measure the effect of interventions, such as prompting, on economic biases.

# Major Findings:

1. LLMs exhibit systematic behavioral biases, such as loss aversion, anchoring, and framing, which lead to suboptimal economic decisions.
2. Utility theory enables the quantification and comparison of economic behavior against benchmarks such as perfect rationality or human behavior.
3. The economic behavior of current LLMs is neither entirely human-like nor entirely economicus-like, and most LLMs struggle to maintain consistent economic behavior across settings.
4. The proposed approach can measure the effect of interventions, such as prompting, on economic biases.

# Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper provides a novel approach to evaluate the economic biases of LLMs, which can be useful for deploying LLMs to support human decision-making.
2. The findings highlight the need for further research to improve the economic biases of existing LLMs and develop more human-like versions of future LLMs.
3. The paper does not address the potential limitations of using utility theory to evaluate the economic biases of LLMs, such as the assumption of rationality and the difficulty of measuring subjective preferences.
4. The paper does not discuss the potential ethical implications of using LLMs for economic decision-making, such as the risk of perpetuating existing biases or creating new ones.
5. The paper does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the economic biases of all available LLMs, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.

Overall, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of LLM evaluation by proposing a novel approach to evaluate the economic biases of LLMs. However, further research is needed to address the limitations of the proposed approach and explore the potential ethical
