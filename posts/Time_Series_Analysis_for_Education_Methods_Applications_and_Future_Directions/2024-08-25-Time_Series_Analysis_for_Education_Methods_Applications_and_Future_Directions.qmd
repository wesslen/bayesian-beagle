**Summary:**

This paper provides a comprehensive review of time series analysis techniques specifically within the educational context. The authors explore the landscape of educational data analytics, categorizing various data sources and types relevant to education. They then review four prominent time series methods—forecasting, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection—illustrating their specific application points in educational settings. The paper also presents a range of educational scenarios and applications, focusing on how these methods are employed to address diverse educational tasks. Finally, the authors discuss future directions, including personalized learning analytics, multimodal data fusion, and the role of large language models (LLMs) in educational time series.

**Major Findings:**

1. Time series analysis techniques, such as forecasting, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection, have significant applications in educational contexts, enabling more informed decision-making and personalized learning experiences.
2. The integration of multiple time series methods can be employed simultaneously to improve educational outcomes, addressing complex sequential educational challenges.
3. A detailed taxonomy of educational data, categorizing various sources and types, is essential for both current and future applications in educational analysis.
4. Emerging trends and future research opportunities in educational analysis include the integration of advanced techniques, such as multimodal fusion and LLMs, in educational time series.

**Analysis and Critique:**

This paper offers a comprehensive overview of time series analysis in educational contexts, covering mainstream methods and their practical applications in real-world educational scenarios. The authors emphasize the importance of a detailed taxonomy of educational data, which is crucial for understanding and applying time series techniques in education. However, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the limitations and potential biases of these methods, as well as the challenges associated with integrating advanced techniques in educational time series. Additionally, the authors could provide more concrete examples of how these methods have been applied in specific educational settings, highlighting their impact on student outcomes and learning experiences.
