# Learning to Generate Text in Arbitrary Writing Styles

## Major Findings
- **Instruction-tuned language models** struggle to reproduce author-specific style in a few-shot setting, even with recent large LMs such as GPT-3.5.
- A proposed approach using **contrastively-trained representations** and a combination of generative re-scoring and discriminative control can effectively generate text in an author-specific style in various conditions, including unconditional generation and style transfer.
- The proposed style transfer approach can be adapted to serve as an effective **author anonymization** technique, defeating authorship attribution while preserving meaning.

## Introduction
- The paper discusses the problem of generating text in the style of an arbitrary author based on a small writing sample, emphasizing the difficulty of this task due to the sparse signal of stylometric features.

## Preliminaries
- The goal is to produce text in a particular target style while satisfying other criteria, such as diverse outputs and meaning preservation.
- The proposed approach involves future regressors and energy-based models for non-autoregressive generation.

## Guiding generations towards a target style representation
- Using a **regression model** to guide a language model to produce text in a target style.
- The resulting author-specific LM can be incorporated in an **energy-based model** for non-autoregressive generation.

## Style Control
- The proposed decoding strategy (EBM) performs competitively with large instruction-tuned LMs, outperforming in-context learning.
- Interpolating between two target author style vectors yields interpretable results, indicating that control vectors capture intuitive stylistic features and can successfully reproduce those features in generated text.
- Samples from the proposed approach circumvent machine-generated text detectors at a higher rate and address concerns with producing more in-domain detection data.

## Style Transfer
- The proposed approach achieves style accuracy comparable to large LMs while requiring only a fraction of the number of parameters.
- The trade-off between stylistic accuracy and content preservation is observed.

## Anonymization
- The proposed style transfer approach succeeds in reducing the detection rate through style transfer, serving as an effective author anonymization technique.

## Detection of Generated Text
- Detection of LM generated text becomes more tractable with basic classification approaches when more in-domain data is available.

## Related Work
- The paper discusses the limitations of automatic evaluation metrics and the use of discriminative models to guide generation.

## Conclusion
The paper addresses the potential applications and broader impact of style-controlled text generation, acknowledging both positive and potential misuse concerns regarding machine-text detection.

## Critique
- The use of automatic metrics for evaluation may not fully capture the nuanced aspects of author-specific style and meaning preservation.
- The heavy reliance on large corpora of social media data for training style representations might introduce biases and privacy concerns.
