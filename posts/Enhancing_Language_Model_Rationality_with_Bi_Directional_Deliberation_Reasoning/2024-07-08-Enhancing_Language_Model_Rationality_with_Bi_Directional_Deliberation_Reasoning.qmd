### Summary:

The paper introduces BI-Directional DEliberation Reasoning (BIDDER), a novel reasoning approach designed to enhance the decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional unidirectional reasoning methods, BIDDER incorporates principles of rational decision-making, such as managing uncertainty and predicting expected utility. The approach involves three key processes: inferring hidden states from historical data, using these hidden states to predict future potential states and outcomes, and integrating historical information and long-term outcomes to inform reasoning. BIDDER's effectiveness was tested in two well-defined scenarios: Poker (Limit Texas Hold'em) and Negotiation. The experiments demonstrated that BIDDER significantly improves the decision-making capabilities of LLMs and LLM agents.

### Major Findings:

1. BIDDER is a novel reasoning approach that enhances the decision-making capabilities of LLMs by incorporating principles of rational decision-making, such as managing uncertainty and predicting expected utility.
2. BIDDER involves three key processes: inferring hidden states from historical data, using these hidden states to predict future potential states and outcomes, and integrating historical information and long-term outcomes to inform reasoning.
3. BIDDER's effectiveness was tested in two well-defined scenarios: Poker (Limit Texas Hold'em) and Negotiation. The experiments demonstrated that BIDDER significantly improves the decision-making capabilities of LLMs and LLM agents.

### Analysis and Critique:

While BIDDER shows promise in enhancing the decision-making capabilities of LLMs, there are several potential limitations and areas for further research.

1. The effectiveness of BIDDER may be dependent on the quality and quantity of historical data available. In scenarios with limited historical data, BIDDER's ability to infer hidden states and predict future outcomes may be compromised.
2. The integration of historical information and long-term outcomes to inform reasoning may be computationally intensive, potentially limiting the scalability of BIDDER in complex decision-making scenarios.
3. The experiments conducted in the paper are limited to two well-defined scenarios. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of BIDDER in a wider range of decision-making scenarios.
4. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of B
