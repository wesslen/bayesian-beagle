### Summary:
- Large language models (LLMs) are transforming the way information is retrieved with vast amounts of knowledge being summarized and presented via natural language conversations.
- LLMs are prone to highlight the most frequently seen pieces of information from the training set and to neglect the rare ones.
- In the field of biomedical research, latest discoveries are key to academic and industrial actors and are obscured by the abundance of an ever-increasing literature corpus (the information overload problem).
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to alleviate some of the shortcomings of LLMs by augmenting the prompts with context retrieved from external datasets.
- In this study, a novel information-retrieval method that leverages a knowledge graph to downsample clusters of overrepresented concepts in the biomedical literature is introduced.
- The retrieval performance of this method is about twice better than embedding similarity alternatives on both precision and recall.
- Both embedding similarity and knowledge graph retrieval methods can be advantageously combined into a hybrid model that outperforms both, enabling potential improvements to biomedical question-answering models.

### Major Findings:
1. LLMs are prone to highlight the most frequently seen pieces of information from the training set and to neglect the rare ones.
2. A novel information-retrieval method that leverages a knowledge graph to downsample clusters of overrepresented concepts in the biomedical literature is introduced.
3. The retrieval performance of this method is about twice better than embedding similarity alternatives on both precision and recall.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of LLMs in retrieving biomedical knowledge and proposes a novel method to address these limitations.
- The use of a knowledge graph to downsample clusters of overrepresented concepts in the biomedical literature is a significant contribution to the field of information retrieval.
- The hybrid model that combines both embedding similarity and knowledge graph retrieval methods is a promising approach for improving biomedical question-answering models.
- The study does not address potential ethical or privacy concerns related to the use of large language models and knowledge graphs in biomedical research, which could be a potential limitation.
