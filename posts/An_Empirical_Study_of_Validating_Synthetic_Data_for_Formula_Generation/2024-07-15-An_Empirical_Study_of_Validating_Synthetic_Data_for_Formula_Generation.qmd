### Summary:
- The paper presents an empirical study on the impact of validating synthetic training examples with surrogate objectives that evaluate the accuracy of synthetic annotations for formula generation in spreadsheets.
- The authors demonstrate that validation improves performance over raw data across four models (2 open and 2 closed weight).
- Interestingly, validation tends to prune more challenging examples, but it increases the complexity of problems that models can solve after being fine-tuned on validated data.

### Major Findings:
1. The study introduces three surrogate objectives (output prediction, alternative code generation, and classification) to predict the accuracy of synthetic natural language in the NL-to-Formula task.
2. Empirical analysis shows that fine-tuning models on validated subsets of synthetic data improves performance in predicting formulas compared to using raw data.
3. Models fine-tuned on validated data perform better on more complex problems and show a reduction in training time.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The paper provides a novel approach to improving the performance of models in generating formulas for spreadsheets by validating synthetic data.
- The use of surrogate objectives to predict the accuracy of synthetic natural language is a promising approach to improving the quality of synthetic data.
- The study demonstrates the benefits of fine-tuning models on validated data, including improved performance and reduced training time.
- However, the study does not address the potential limitations of using synthetic data, such as the risk of overfitting or the lack of diversity in the data.
- Additionally, the study focuses on a specific task (NL-to-Formula) and does not explore the generalizability of the approach to other tasks.
- Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in other domains and to address potential limitations.
