# Boosting Large Language Model for Speech Synthesis: An Empirical Study

## Main Findings
- Directly fine-tuning **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with **LoRA** does not outperform the baseline and requires substantial computational resources.
- **Superposed LLMs and VALL-E** can enhance speech quality, demonstrating that LLMs can encode both acoustic and textual tokens.
- **Coupled LLMs and VALL-E** achieves the best performance, significantly outperforming the baseline in word error rate, speaker similarity, and speech naturalness.

## Introduction
- **LLMs** have revolutionized natural language processing and are extending to other modalities such as speech and vision.
- Most prior work focuses on aligning speech representation with LLM input space.

## Methodology
### Model Components
- Components include LLM, speech compression model (Encodec), and codec language model (VALL-E).
### Integration Strategies
1. Directly Fine-tuned LLMs
2. Superposed LLMs and VALL-E
3. Coupled LLMs and VALL-E

## Related Work
- Explores the application of LLMs to speech and compares to prior work on multi-modal LLMs and large audio generative models.

## Experiments
- Conducted on ASR datasets and evaluated on LibriSpeech dev-clean, dev-other, test-clean, test-other datasets.
- Revealed the impact of model size, continual pre-training, pre-trained VALL-E, and compared LoRA vs. full fine-tuning in VALL-E.

## Analysis
- Detailed analyses include the effect of model size, continual pre-training, pre-trained VALL-E, and comparison of LoRA vs. full fine-tuning in VALL-E.

## Conclusion
- Directly fine-tuning LLMs with LoRA does not match the performance of the baseline, while superposed LLMs and coupled LLMs with VALL-E outperform the baseline.

## Critique
- The paper could benefit from a more extensive analysis of the computational resources required for different methods and further exploration of the limitations of each integration strategy.
