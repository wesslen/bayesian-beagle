### Summary:

The article introduces ULTRA, a framework designed for document-level event argument extraction (DocEAE) task using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Flan-UL2. The framework extract arguments from news articles, addressing challenges such as positional bias and cost-effectiveness. ULTRA sequentially reads text chunks to generate candidate argument sets and uses self-refinement to drop non-pertinent candidates. The article demonstrates that ULTRA outperforms strong baselines and mitigates the issues associated with traditional supervised approaches and the use of closed LLMs like ChatGPT.

### Major Findings:
1. **Importance of Event-Centric Understanding:**
    - Understanding event structures is crucial as it facilitates a deeper comprehension of communication patterns and behavior trends.

2. **Challenges in Document-Level Event Argument Extraction (DocEAE):**
    - Existing research primarily focuses on sentence-level event argument extraction, but in news journalism, events are described at the document level, necessitating the need for document-level EAE.

3. **Introduction of ULTRA Framework:**
    - ULTRA introduces a cost-effective hierarchical framework that outperforms strong baselines and addresses challenges such as positional bias and cost-effectiveness.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article effectively introduces ULTRA, a novel framework for DocEAE using LLMs. However, it primarily focuses on demonstrating the efficacy of ULTRA without thoroughly discussing potential limitations or biases. The article could benefit from a more comprehensive critical analysis, addressing potential challenges in real-world implementation, limitations of the proposed methodology, and ethical considerations associated with the use of open-source LLMs for information extraction tasks. Additionally, it would be valuable to include a discussion on the generalizability of ULTRA across different domains and its potential impact on downstream NLP applications. Furthermore, the article could benefit from a more extensive comparative analysis, contrasting ULTRA with a wider range of existing methodologies and frameworks.
