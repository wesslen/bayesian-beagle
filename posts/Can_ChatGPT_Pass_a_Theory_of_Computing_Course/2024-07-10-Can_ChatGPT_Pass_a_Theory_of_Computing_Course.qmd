### Summary:

- The paper explores the ability of the ChatGPT Large Language Model (LLM) to pass a Theory of Computing (ToC) course.
- Two experiments were conducted: (1) evaluating ChatGPT's performance on the authors' own ToC course exams, and (2) creating a database of sample ToC questions and responses to accommodate other ToC offerings.
- ChatGPT was found to be adequate at understanding common formal definitions and answering "simple"-style questions, such as true/false and multiple-choice. However, it often makes nonsensical claims in open-ended responses, such as proofs.

### Major Findings:

1. ChatGPT can pass a ToC course, achieving a B- to B average letter grade.
2. The model is capable of understanding common formal definitions and answering true/false and multiple-choice questions.
3. ChatGPT struggles with open-ended responses, such as proofs, and often makes nonsensical claims in these contexts.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of ChatGPT's ability to pass a ToC course, but it does not explore the model's performance in other computer science courses.
- The study could be expanded to include a larger sample of ToC courses and a more diverse set of questions to better understand the model's limitations.
- The authors acknowledge that ChatGPT suffers from being largely unable to prove claims on which it has not been trained, which is a significant limitation in the context of a ToC course.
- The paper does not discuss the potential implications of using LLMs like ChatGPT in academic settings, such as the impact on student learning and academic integrity.
- The authors recommend keeping assessments that are closed-resources, such as in-person exams, as the majority of the course grade to mitigate potential issues with LLMs.
- The paper suggests that an essential part of a successful ToC course is for students to think critically about claims and to verify them, which may be challenging when using LLMs.
- The authors recommend incorporating an assignment that involves asking an LLM to prove a claim from a previous assessment and then having students point out every error within the LLM's output.
- The paper suggests that Chat
