### Summary:

- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in mathematical reasoning benchmarks, but there are debates about their understanding and application of mathematical knowledge.
- A new benchmark, GSM-Plus, is introduced to evaluate the robustness of LLMs' math reasoning capability by testing various question variations.
- The experiments on 25 LLMs and 4 prompting techniques show that LLMs' performances are not robust, with mistakes made even on previously solved problems with new statements or altered targets.
- An iterative method generating and verifying intermediate thoughts based on reasoning goals and calculation results is explored to achieve more robust performance.

### Major Findings:
1. **Performance varies among LLMs:** Different LLMs exhibit varying levels of math reasoning abilities, with even top-performing models making mistakes on altered problems.
2. **Non-robust performance:** LLMs struggle with new statements or altered targets, even
