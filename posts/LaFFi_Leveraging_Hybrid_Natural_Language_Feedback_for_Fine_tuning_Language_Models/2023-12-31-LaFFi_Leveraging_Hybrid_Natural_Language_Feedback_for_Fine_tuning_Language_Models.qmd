### Major Takeaways

1. **LaFFi** framework introduces a novel approach to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating **natural language feedback** within the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) paradigm, significantly improving accuracy in in-domain question-answering tasks.

2. The study presents a fine-tuning framework consisting of four key stages: **Answer prediction, Feedback Annotation, Supervised Feedback Prediction, and LoRA fine-tuning** to efficiently leverage natural language feedback and improve LLM performance.

3. LaFFi surpasses non-fine-tuned models and SFT, particularly in low-data scenarios, demonstrating substantial performance improvements and capturing both **global and local token dependencies**, enhancing few-shot learning.

### Abstract

- Fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often results in simple mistakes and hallucinations on reasoning tasks, especially in the absence of external feedback. This paper introduces **LaFFi**, an alternative to SFT that integrates natural language feedback to improve the accuracy of LLMs in question-answering tasks, even with limited datasets.

### Introduction

- Large language models (LLMs) have become widely adopted due to their effectiveness in natural language processing tasks. The **transformer architecture** has facilitated a wide range of applications, with LLMs being fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks to tailor them to user requirements.

### Methodology

- The LaFFi framework involves **four key steps**: Answer prediction, Feedback Annotation, Supervised Feedback Prediction, and LoRA Fine-tuning, to enable LLMs to efficiently predict and learn from natural language feedback.

### Experiments

- LaFFi outperforms both the non-fine-tuned models and SFT, demonstrating substantial performance improvements and capturing **global and local token dependencies**, enhancing few-shot learning.

### Analysis

- Visualizations indicate LaFFi's ability to capture **global and local token dependencies**, potentially improving performance by refining LLM's capabilities in capturing finer token-wise dependencies within the attention blocks.

### Related Work

- Several relevant works in leveraging human natural language feedback for fine-tuning LLMs are listed, demonstrating the growing interest in incorporating natural language feedback to enhance LLM performance.

### Conclusion

- LaFFi delivers substantial performance improvements, surpassing non-fine-tuned models and SFT, especially in low-data scenarios. The study provides insights into the influence of human feedback on Large Language Models and calls for further research in this area.

### Critique

The study's reliance on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset may limit its generalizability, and the resource-intensive nature of human annotation presents a limitation in scalability. Additionally, future research should consider diversifying datasets and evaluating out-of-domain tasks to further validate LaFFi's efficacy.
