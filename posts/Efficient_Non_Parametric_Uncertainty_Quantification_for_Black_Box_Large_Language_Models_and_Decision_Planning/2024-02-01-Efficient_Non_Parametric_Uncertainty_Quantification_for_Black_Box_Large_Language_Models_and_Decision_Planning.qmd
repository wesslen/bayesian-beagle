### **Summary:**
- The paper focuses on decision planning with uncertainty estimation to address the hallucination problem in language models.
- It introduces a non-parametric uncertainty quantification method for large language models (LLMs) and outlines a systematic design for a decision-making agent.
- The uncertainty estimation and decision-making agent design offer a cost-efficient approach for AI agent development.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The paper introduces a non-parametric uncertainty quantification method for LLMs, efficiently estimating point-wise dependencies between input-decision on the fly with a single inference, without access to token logits.
2. It outlines a systematic design for a decision-making agent, generating actions based on user prompts and asking for user preferences when more than one action has high estimated point-wise dependencies.
3. The uncertainty estimation and decision-making agent design offer a cost-efficient approach for AI agent development.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges and solutions for uncertainty quantification in decision planning with language models.
- The proposed approach is innovative and efficient, but the evaluation metrics used are stringent, and future work should include measures of semantic similarity and human study in addition to exact match.
- The statistical guarantee obtained from conformal prediction does not strongly correlate with the actual performance in the evaluation, indicating potential limitations in the approach.
- The paper offers valuable insights into the development of AI agents for decision planning, but further research is needed to address the limitations and potential biases identified in the text.
