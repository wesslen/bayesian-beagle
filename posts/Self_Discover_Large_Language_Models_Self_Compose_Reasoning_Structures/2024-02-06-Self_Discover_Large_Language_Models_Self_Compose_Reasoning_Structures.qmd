### Summary:
- Self-Discover is a framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-discover task-intrinsic reasoning structures to tackle complex reasoning problems.
- The framework substantially improves the performance of LLMs on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as BigBench-Hard, grounded agent reasoning, and MATH.
- Self-Discover outperforms inference-intensive methods and requires significantly fewer inference compute.

### Major Findings:
1. Self-Discover substantially improves the performance of LLMs on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as BigBench-Hard, grounded agent reasoning, and MATH.
2. Self-Discover outperforms inference-intensive methods such as CoT-Self-Consistency by more than 20%, while requiring 10-40x fewer inference compute.
3. The self-discovered reasoning structures are universally applicable across model families and share commonalities with human reasoning patterns.

### Analysis and Critique:
- Self-Discover demonstrates significant improvements in LLM reasoning capabilities, especially on tasks requiring diverse world knowledge.
- The framework is efficient, requiring significantly fewer inference compute compared to other methods.
- Error analysis reveals that the majority of model failures are due to errors in intermediate calculations, suggesting the need for improvements in step-wise calculation accuracy of LLMs.
- The self-discovered reasoning structures share commonalities with human reasoning patterns, indicating potential for human-AI collaboration in complex problem-solving.
