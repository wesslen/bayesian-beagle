### **Summary:**
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle with hierarchical text structures, requiring additional processing steps to extract task-desired properties.
- TEAROOM proposes a novel framework that incorporates a tree-based hard attention mechanism and a self-motivation strategy to address these challenges.
- Experimental evaluations across three benchmark datasets demonstrate TEAROOM's effectiveness in estimating task-specific properties and gradually approaching the underlying golden truth through multiple inferences.

### **Major Findings:**
1. TEAROOM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in experimental evaluations across three benchmark datasets, showing its effectiveness in estimating task-specific properties.
2. The tree-based hard attention mechanism enables LLMs to efficiently capture hierarchical relationships, addressing limitations associated with processing lengthy plain text inputs.
3. The self-motivation strategy enhances LLM alignment from the current prediction towards the golden truth via multiple iterations of inference.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The proposed TEAROOM framework demonstrates significant improvements in estimating task-specific properties and aligning with specific tasks. However, the study could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential limitations and challenges, such as inference time and scalability.
- The self-motivation strategy shows promise in enhancing the learning process of LLMs, but further research is needed to explore its applicability across different domains and datasets.
- The ablation study highlights the critical role of the tree-based hard attention mechanism and the self-motivation strategy in the overall performance of TEAROOM, emphasizing the importance of these components in addressing the challenges of hierarchical text structures.
