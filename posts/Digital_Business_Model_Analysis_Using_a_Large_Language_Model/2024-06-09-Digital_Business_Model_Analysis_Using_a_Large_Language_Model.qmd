# Summary:

The study proposes an LLM-based method for comparing and analyzing similar companies from different business domains to aid in designing new digital business models. The authors use documents from Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) known as "DX Stocks" for analysis, which include over 350 DX examples. The method involves preprocessing report texts, vectorizing the texts using a cutting-edge Japanese pretrained LLM, selecting a DX case of a reference company, calculating cosine similarity to measure the similarity between the DX case of the reference company and those of different companies in different business domains, and selecting two companies with the highest similarity scores for analysis.

## Major Findings:

1. The study demonstrates the potential of using LLMs for analyzing and designing new business models, which is still an evolving field with scarce research.
2. The proposed method can support idea generation in digital business model design by learning patterns from the commonalities of DX cases and using this knowledge as a reference when considering DX initiatives.
3. The analysis examples show that LLM can effectively extract similar DX cases, not only within the same industry but also from different industries, and consider their commonalities to support the ideation of digital business models.

## Analysis and Critique:

* The study's findings are preliminary, and further research is needed to refine the analytical methods using advanced NLP technologies and broaden the examination of digital business models across a wider spectrum of industries.
* The proposed method potentially offers companies easy access to insights into the use of digital technologies and business model innovations that have previously been less accessible.
* The authors plan to develop a recommendation system, possibly implemented via chatbots, that could suggest similar cases to act as a catalyst for companies aiming to accelerate their DX efforts.
* The study makes certain academic contributions by demonstrating the potential of this approach, but more research is needed to fully understand its implications and limitations.
