## Summary of "Revealing Networks: Understanding Effective Teacher Practices in AI-Supported Classrooms"

### Major Findings:
1. The study found that incorporating out-of-tutor teacher practices significantly improved the inference of student learning rates in AI tutors.
2. Students with low learning rates tended to exhibit more hint use after monitoring by the teacher, while after extended visits, these students showed learning behavior similar to their peers with high learning rates.
3. Qualitative analysis revealed that teacher support during screen monitoring and talking differed for students with low and high learning rates, with low learning rate students receiving more procedural support and high learning rate students receiving abstract support.

### Background:
- Learning in AI-supported classrooms involves students learning with AI-based systems while the teacher facilitates learning. Prior work has found that the role of teacher practice for effective learning with AI tutors is understudied and there is a lack of studies analyzing student learning through the lens of teacher practices.
- Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) integrates data from various modalities to understand learning processes, and quantitative ethnography methods are increasingly used in learning analytics to model complex dependencies between data sets.

### Methods:
- The study used Transmodal Ordered Network Analysis to model temporal relationships between teacher practices and student learning in AI-supported classrooms.
- Data sets included student interaction data with an AI tutor, classroom observation notes, and teacher spatial positions during classroom practice.
- Feature engineering involved creating codes for teacher practices and student behaviors and grouping students by their learning rates.

### Results:
- Including out-of-tutor teacher practices significantly improved the inference of student learning rates within the AI tutor.
- Connection patterns for students with low and high learning rates differed, with low learning rate students exhibiting more hint use after monitoring by the teacher.
- Teacher visits led to changes in student behavior, with low learning rate students exhibiting more desirable learning behavior after extended visits.

### Discussion:
- The study provides insights into the associations between teacher practices and student learning rates and the differential impact of teacher support on students with low and high learning rates.
- Qualitative analysis revealed differences in the type of teacher support provided to students with low and high learning rates, suggesting potential areas for intervention and improvement.

### Critique:
- The study relies heavily on observational and log data, which may not fully capture the complexity of teacher-student interactions and learning processes. There may be confounding variables or unobserved factors influencing the relationships identified.
- The study does not address potential biases in the observation and coding of teacher practices, which could impact the validity of the findings.

Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the role of teacher practices in AI-supported classrooms and highlights the potential for further research and intervention to improve learning outcomes.
