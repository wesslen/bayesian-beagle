### Summary

- Weakly-supervised Phrase Grounding (WPG) is an emerging task in multimodal learning that involves inferring fine-grained phrase-region matching using coarse-grained sentence-image pairs for training.
- Existing studies on WPG largely ignore the implicit phrase-region matching relations, which are crucial for evaluating the capability of models in understanding deep multimodal semantics.
- This paper proposes an Implicit-Enhanced Causal Inference (IECI) approach that leverages both intervention and counterfactual techniques to tackle the challenges of modeling implicit relations and highlighting them beyond the explicit.
- A high-quality implicit-enhanced dataset is annotated to evaluate IECI, and detailed evaluations show the great advantages of IECI over state-of-the-art baselines.

### Major Findings

1. The IECI approach significantly outperforms advanced multimodal LLMs on the implicit-enhanced dataset, demonstrating its potential for evaluating multimodal LLMs in this direction.
2. The intervention technique in IECI effectively mitigates confounding bias in modeling implicit relations, while the counterfactual technique highlights implicit relations beyond the explicit, addressing the imbalance problem between them.
3. The annotated implicit-enhanced dataset provides a valuable resource for evaluating the ability of models in understanding deep multimodal semantics.

### Analysis and Critique

- The paper focuses on the implicit phrase-region matching relations problem in WPG, which is an important aspect often overlooked in existing studies.
- The IECI approach combines both intervention and counterfactual techniques, providing a comprehensive solution to the challenges of modeling implicit relations and highlighting them beyond the explicit.
- The annotated implicit-enhanced dataset is a valuable contribution, but its generalizability to other datasets and tasks should be further investigated.
- The paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the limitations and potential biases in the dataset and the IECI approach.
- The paper could also explore the application of the IECI approach to other multimodal learning tasks to further validate its effectiveness.
