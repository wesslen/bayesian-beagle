The study suggests that simulating human opinion dynamics is within the capabilities of LLMs and that they have the potential to play an important role in collective processes of opinion formation in online social media.\n\n\n### Introduction to Large Language Models:\n\n- LLMs possess sophisticated domain over language semantics, enabling them to function as social agents capable of complex interactions with humans and other artificial agents.\n- They have raised concerns about the potential spread of misinformation and harmful content in online discourse.\n\n### Methods:\n\n- The study designed a synthetic persuasion dialogue scenario on climate change, where a 'convincer' LLM agent generated persuasive arguments for a 'skeptic' LLM agent, with human judges evaluating the persuasiveness of machine-generated arguments.\n- Conversation setup involved a dyadic interaction between the 'convincer' and the 'skeptic', with varying levels of skepticism and persuasive language incorporated.\n- Evaluations were conducted to quantify persuasiveness and rank the dimensions of persuasive language based on human judgments and LLM interactions.\n\n### Results:\n\n- The study observed an inverse association between the skeptic's stubbornness and the probability of persuasion, with certain dimensions such as trust and support being most effective in altering the skeptic's viewpoint.\n- Human evaluations generally aligned with LLM preferences for social dimensions in persuasive arguments, with some notable differences such as a stronger preference for knowledge-based arguments among humans and differences in dimensions' persuasive strengths.\n\n### Discussion:\n\n- The study highlighted limitations in the experimental design and offered future research directions including diversifying agent profiles, enhancing ecological validity, and further exploration of effective system prompts and human judgment methodologies.\n- Ethical considerations were raised regarding the potential risks of deploying LLMs for persuasive purposes on social media and the need for research on understanding and combating malicious uses of generative AI.\n\n### Critique:\n\nThe study provides valuable insights into the persuasive capabilities of LLMs, but it is limited in its ecological validity and may not fully capture the complexities of real-world social interactions. Additionally, while the study discusses potential ethical concerns, it could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of the ethical implications of deploying LLMs for persuasive purposes and the potential societal impacts.

The study uses a range of LLMs and tasks to demonstrate how LLMs may be exposed to task examples during pre-training, leading to inflated performance in zero-shot and few-shot settings. The authors employ various methods, such as training data inspection, task example extraction, and chronological analysis, to provide evidence of task contamination. The results indicate that closed-sourced models may demonstrate inflated performance in zero-shot or few-shot evaluation, and are therefore not trustworthy baselines in these settings. Additionally, the paper uncovers challenges in assessing task contamination due to different formats of training data and the difficulty in extracting task examples. The findings suggest a need for caution in relying on LLMs for zero-shot and few-shot tasks and call for additional research to understand the extent of task contamination for large language models.\n\n### Major Takeaways\n\n1. Closed-sourced models may demonstrate inflated performance in zero-shot or few-shot evaluation, casting doubt on their trustworthiness as baselines in these settings.\n2. LLMs rarely show statistically significant improvements over majority baselines in both zero and few-shot settings for tasks without demonstrated possibility of task contamination.\n3.

The paper presents a comprehensive comparison of different hallucination detection methods at both the passage and word levels, demonstrating the effectiveness of the RAGTruth dataset in fine-tuning LLMs for competitive performance in hallucination detection.\n3. The study shows the potential of developing better hallucination detection methods using RAGTruth, as it can significantly reduce the occurrence of hallucinations in the responses from LLMs, even for models with inherently low hallucination rates.\n\n### Introduction\n- **Hallucination Challenges in LLMs**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating content that is not based on factual or accurate information, leading to hallucinations. Various methods have been developed to mitigate hallucinations, but reliable detection remains a challenge.\n- **Need for Benchmark Datasets**: The lack of high-quality, large-scale datasets specifically designed for hallucination detection, particularly in RAG settings, is a key challenge.\n\n### Construction Process of RAGTruth\n- **Response Generation**: Responses were generated using six models for Summarization, Question Answering, and Data-to-Text tasks.\n- **Human Annotation**: Annotators manually annotated specific spans of text containing hallucinated information and categorized them into four types. Additional annotations were provided for adaptive evaluation.\n- **Annotations for Adaptive Evaluation**: Two additional annotations, \"Incorrectly Refusing to Answer\" and \"Differences in Handling Null Value,\" were provided to accurately reflect contentious situations.\n\n### Hallucination Benchmark Analysis\n- **Basic Statistics**: RAGTruth is considerably large in scale, contains longer prompt and response lengths, and features a higher frequency of baseless info hallucinations.\n- **Hallucination Statistics**: The data-to-text task exhibited the highest frequency of hallucinations, especially influenced by stereotypes inherent in the business data.\n- **Hallucination vs Models**: OpenAI\u2019s models demonstrated notably lower hallucination rates compared to others, and a negative correlation was observed between the model scale and the hallucination density.\n- **Hallucination Suppression**: Strategies utilizing the hallucination detector significantly reduced the hallucination rate across different LLMs and tasks.\n\n### Experimental Results\n- **Response-level Detection**: Fine-tuning Llama-2-13B using the RAGTruth dataset achieved the best performance in response-level detection, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in improving the model\u2019s detection ability for hallucinations.\n- **Span-level Detection**: Span-level detection remained challenging, with the fine-tuned model showing improved capability, though still falling short of perfect detection.\n- **Hallucination Suppression**: Strategies employing the fine-tuned hallucination detector significantly reduced the rate of hallucinations across different LLMs and tasks.\n\n### Critique\n- The study demonstrates advancements in the detection and suppression of hallucinations in LLMs, but more comprehensive evaluation metrics and real-world applicability of the findings could add strength to the conclusions.

The interaction unfolded in five stages with fixed and generated text for different stages.\n\n- **Persuasive Language of the Convincer**: The Convincer was instructed to generate arguments incorporating different dimensions of social pragmatics, and their effectiveness was assessed.\n\n- **Stubbornness of the Skeptic**: The study tested various levels of the Skeptic's stubbornness and evaluated their impact on persuasion.\n\n- **Evaluation**: The persuasiveness of LLM-generated arguments was quantified and compared with evaluations by human judges through crowdsourced annotations.\n\n### Results\n- **Persuading AI Agents**: The probability of persuasion was found to decrease with the Skeptic\u2019s stubbornness. The dimensions of trust, support, and status were most effective in altering the Skeptic\u2019s viewpoint.\n\n- **Persuading Humans**: Human evaluations revealed parallels with LLM agent dynamics, with trust, support, knowledge, and status being ranked higher. However, humans exhibited a stronger preference for knowledge-based arguments compared to LLM agents.\n\n### Discussion\nThe discussion section highlighted the study's limitations and proposed avenues for future research, including multi-turn conversations among multiple agents and diverse profiles for individual agents.\n\n### Critique\nThe study showcases the potential of LLMs in persuasive language generation but has limitations in replicating complex human dynamics and understanding the mechanisms that induce LLM agents to signal a change of opinion. Additionally, the oversimplification, lack of diverse profiles for agents, and a focus on single-turn interactions limit the generalizability of the findings to real-world social media interactions. The study also acknowledges the ethical implications of deploying AI agents for persuasion and the potential risks associated with their use, suggesting the need for research to understand and mitigate those risks.

The company's existing recommender, RevRecV1, was found to be inaccurate and slow due to its reliance on file authorship frequency for reviewer assignment. The authors developed RevRecV2, which uses author-reviewer familiarity, reviewer workload, and the bystander effect factors to improve accuracy and latency. They found significant improvements in accuracy (14 percentage points) and reduction in latency (14 times) with RevRecV2. RevRecWL, designed to balance reviewer workload, showed a reduction in workload when a reasonable candidate with lower workload was available. However, there were no statistically significant changes in review cycle time or latency. The BystanderRecRnd, designed to reduce the bystander effect, reduced time-in-review by 11.6% with no regressions in guardrail metrics.\n\n### Major Takeaways\n1. **Improvements in Accuracy and Latency with RevRecV2**: RevRecV2 led to a 14 percentage point improvement in accuracy and a 14 times reduction in latency at the 90th percentile, with recommendations being selected by authors 27% more often.\n2. **Balancing Reviewer Workload with RevRecWL**: RevRecWL showed a reduction in workload when a reasonable candidate with lower workload was available, but no statistically significant changes in review cycle time or latency were observed.\n3. **Reducing the Bystander Effect with BystanderRecRnd**: BystanderRecRnd reduced time-in-review by 11.6% without any regressions in guardrail metrics.\n\n### Critique\nOne potential problem with the paper is the dependency on historical data for simulating reviewer performance, which may not fully represent real-world conditions.

However, existing methods may impact the accuracy of the models, especially when embedding watermarks.\n\n#### Related Work\n- Backdoor attacks, particularly training-based and training-free backdoor methods, are prevalent in the context of model security.\n- Model watermarking can be categorized into black-box and no-box watermarking, where the verifier\u2019s knowledge and control of the model differ.\n- Backdoor techniques are commonly used for black-box model watermarking, but they can impact the functionality of the original model.\n\n#### A Performance-lossless Branch Watermarking Protocol for Model\n- The paper details a branch watermarking protocol that aims to protect model intellectual property without affecting the original model's functionality. It describes the threat model, proposed model watermarking protocol, and analyzes potential attacks.\n- The protocol includes two main modules: the model and the watermark, with several sub-modules. It introduces a formal security analysis that demonstrates the lossless performance of the model watermarking protocol.\n\n#### Performance-lossless and Secure Watermarking for Language Model\n- A concrete example of the branch backdoor-based watermarking protocol for a language model is provided, demonstrating the protocol's implementation in practice.\n- The paper further analyzes possible attacks against the watermarking protocol and proposes a more secure instantiation strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Critique\nThe paper provides a comprehensive overview of the proposed branch backdoor-based model watermarking protocol and offers a detailed analysis of its implementation for language models. However, there are several potential issues and areas for improvement:\n1. **Complexity of Cryptographic Primitives:** The use of advanced cryptographic primitives like MAC and ECDSA may introduce complexity and potential implementation challenges in practical scenarios, which should be addressed.\n2. **Practical Implementation Challenges:** The paper should address the practicality and potential challenges of implementing the proposed model watermarking protocol in real-world scenarios, considering factors such as computational overhead and resource constraints.\n3. **Evaluation and Validation:** While the paper outlines the theoretical aspects of the protocol, it would benefit from empirical validation and testing in real-world settings to demonstrate its effectiveness and practical utility.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a comprehensive theoretical framework for a performance-lossless branch watermarking protocol, but it could benefit from addressing the practical implementation challenges and providing empirical evidence of its real-world performance.", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06488v1", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2312.06488v1", "abs": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06488v1"}, "authors": ["Na Zhao", "Kejiang Chen", "Weiming Zhang", "Nenghai Yu"], "title": "Performance-lossless Black-box Model Watermarking", "subtitle": "Propose watermarking protocol protects model IP with branch backdoor-based method, verified with language generation task.", "categories": ["robustness"], "publish_date": "2023-12-11", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "image": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2312.06488v1/extracted/5288023/imgs/threat.png", "word_count": 16235, "is_truncated": true}}

The limitations of the speech recognition system affected the overall usability and efficiency of the interface.\n\n3. **User Studies and Performance Evaluation**: User studies conducted at different phases revealed insights into the performance and user experience of TeamCAD. The interface showed promise in equalizing the design process for users with varying skill levels, but also highlighted the need for further improvements in **speech recognition**.\n\n### System Description\n\n- **Speech and Gesture Recognition**: The system relies on speech recognition using the SpeechRecognition Python library, with real-time webcam gesture recognition using MediaPipe. This allows users to utilize voice commands and gestures to interact with a three-dimensional modeling or CAD software.\n\n- **Interface Operation**: TeamCAD uses a heads-up display (HUD) to present a library of voice commands and allows users to manipulate objects through gestures, such as using pinching gestures for selection and grabbing. The system also enables users to issue voice commands for specific transformations and manipulations.\n\n### User Studies and Performance\n\n- **Experimental Phases**: The user studies were conducted in three iterative phases, focusing on prototype, implementation, and final studio phases. The experiments involved tasks such as creating an arch in Blender 3D, recording users' interactions, and measuring time spent on different activities.\n\n- **Performance Evaluation**: Users spent varying amounts of time on different tasks, with manipulating objects and using speech recognition occupying a substantial amount of time. The results showed that speech recognition was less efficient and posed challenges related to robustness and usability.\n\n### Critique\n\nWhile TeamCAD demonstrates the potential for multimodal interfaces in remote collaborative design, the paper acknowledges several challenges, particularly in the area of **speech recognition**. The limitations and biases observed in the performance of speech recognition algorithms need to be addressed to ensure a more robust and user-friendly interface. Additionally, the reliance on third-party libraries and technologies may introduce dependencies and potential compatibility issues in real-world applications. The need for further development and improvement in the performance of the **speech recognition** component is crucial for the successful implementation of TeamCAD in practical design settings.", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.12309v1", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2312.12309v1", "abs": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12309v1"}, "authors": ["Demircan Tas", "Dimitrios Chatzinikolis"], "title": "TeamCAD -- A Multimodal Interface for Remote Computer Aided Design", "subtitle": "TL;DR: TeamCAD improves remote design collaboration with voice and gesture recognition for better user experience.", "categories": ["education"], "publish_date": "2023-12-19", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "image": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2312.12309v1/extracted/5305689/figures/f11p.png", "word_count": 4768, "is_truncated": false}}

The findings suggest that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating advanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed neurons with similar semantics. The paper highlights the challenges of permanent concept removal for improved model safety and the importance of monitoring concept reemergence and developing techniques to mitigate relearning of unsafe concepts.\n\n## Introduction\nLarge language models encode semantic concepts across different languages, architectures, and modalities. The primary objective when pruning such models is to eliminate redundant neurons while preserving the most crucial ones, leading to the assumption that removing important \u201cconcept neurons\u201d will disrupt the model\u2019s structured internal representation of key concepts. However, the paper presents evidence of neuroplasticity in models, allowing them to regain high performance after pruning random or important neurons. This phenomenon, termed \u201cneuroplasticity,\u201d demonstrates a degree of adaptability in such models and has significant implications for model editing.\n\n## Related Work\nThe paper builds on previous works that have analyzed the distribution of concept representations in LLMs and studied performance recovery after pruning. It is noted that prior works artificially redistributed concepts in large language models by modifying the activations of specific neurons, but there is limited understanding of how concept redistribution naturally occurs after pruning. The study also compares its approach with similar works in the field.\n\n## Problem Setting\nThe paper provides a formal definition of concept neurons, concept saliency, and concept similarity, and outlines the process for identifying and pruning top concept neurons in a language model to induce neuroplasticity.\n\n## Method\nThe researchers explore neuroplasticity within a pretrained model by fine-tuning the model for a specific task, identifying and pruning concept neurons, and tracking the redistribution of concepts over the retraining process. They explore the concept saliency and similarity to analyze the redistribution of concepts in the model after neuroplasticity.\n\n## Experimental Setup\nThe study focuses on pruning the specific concept of location names from different LLMs and analyzes the models across different runs. The model architectures, training, and evaluations are clearly described.\n\n## Results\nThe paper presents a detailed analysis of the rapid performance recovery after retraining, high-level concept redistribution, and the relocation of pruned concepts. It also delves into the polysemantic characteristics of neurons after retraining.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how language models learn, adapt, and retain core conceptual representations. It also suggests potential research directions in model editing and transfer learning. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for studying the implications of neuroplasticity-induced polysemanticity to aid the development of interpretable models and the enhanced transfer of learned representations.\n\n## Critique\nThe paper provides valuable insights into neuroplasticity and concept reshaping in LLMs. However, the precise relationship between concept similarity and saliency and the generalizability of the findings to other LLMs require further investigation. Additionally, the paper acknowledges the potential wider impacts of its findings and emphasizes the importance of ethical and responsible AI research.", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01814v1", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2401.01814v1", "abs": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01814v1"}, "authors": ["Michelle Lo", "Shay B.

Distributed knowledge and reduced turnover risk are achieved through code review recommendations that are **aware of code ownership, workload, and knowledge distribution**.\n3. Existing code review recommenders focused solely on finding experts concentrate knowledge on a small group of developers, increasing the risk of knowledge loss from turnover.\n\n\n### Historical Analysis\n- Use of code review naturally distributes knowledge and reduces the number of files at risk to turnover.\n- Recommending reviewers based on ownership increases expertise but raises the number of files at risk to turnover, indicating concentration of knowledge.\n- Workload is not evenly distributed across developers, with top reviewers bearing the majority of the workload.\n\n\n### Simulation Results\n- **LearnRec:** Decreases expertise, distributes workload unevenly, and increases the files at risk to turnover.\n- **RetentionRec:** Increases expertise, slightly increases workload concentration, and reduces the files at risk to turnover.\n- **Sofia:** Increases expertise, slightly increases workload concentration, and reduces the files at risk to turnover.\n- **WhoDo:** Increases expertise, decreases workload concentration, but increases the files at risk to turnover.\n- **SofiaWL:** Increases expertise, decreases workload concentration, and reduces the files at risk to turnover.\n\n### Critique\nThe paper provided valuable insights into code review recommendations, but the impact of the proposed recommenders on developer satisfaction, team dynamics, and long-term project outcomes was not addressed. The focus on reducing the number of files at risk to turnover may inadvertently increase the workload for some developers, potentially leading to burnout and reduced productivity. Additionally, the study did not consider factors such as team diversity and collaboration, which could have significant implications for project success.\n\nThe paper could benefit from further exploration of the potential unintended consequences of workload distribution and turnover reduction on team dynamics and developer well-being.

RAHF proves to be effective, computationally efficient, and easy to implement, capturing and manipulating representations to align with a broad spectrum of human preferences.\n\n3. The study compares RAHF with RL-based methods and other reward-free fine-tuning methods, demonstrating that RAHF outperforms other RL-free approaches in human evaluations and automated metrics, achieving results comparable to RLHF while exhibiting simplicity in implementation and training.\n\n### Related Work\n\n- **Existing methods for aligning LLMs with human preferences** include reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), contrastive learning, and hindsight instruction relabeling.

MoE language models, which use sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, have the potential for faster token generation but also pose challenges due to their large model size.\n\n### Background & Related Work\n\n#### Mixture-of-Experts\n- MoE language models utilize ensembles of specialized models called \"experts\" and a gating function to select the appropriate expert for a given task.\n- The sparse MoE architecture allows for more compute-efficient training and has demonstrated improved perplexity and interpretable expert specializations in natural language processing tasks.\n\n#### Post-training Quantization of LLMs\n- Different quantization schemes, including 4-bit, 3-bit, and 2-bit, have been explored to reduce model size while maintaining performance.\n- The optimal compression rate for most LLMs is around 4 bits per parameter, with recent works focusing on quantizing MoE models.\n\n#### Inference with Parameter Offloading\n- Offloading techniques have been used to manage large model parameters by loading them just-in-time for computation, but they have limitations for interactive inference tasks due to autoregressive token generation.\n\n### Method\nThe study aims to develop techniques for efficiently inferring MoE language models on consumer hardware, focusing on token generation at interactive speeds. Two main strategies are proposed:\n1. **Expert Locality and LRU caching**: Keeping active experts in GPU memory as a \"cache\" for future tokens, leveraging the short sequences of expert activations observed.\n2. **Speculative Expert Loading**: Guessing the likely next experts and loading them speculatively, based on an accurate estimation of next layer's experts using heuristic heuristics based on the hidden states of previous layers.\n\n#### System Design & Implementation Details\nThe implementation includes practical design considerations such as mixed MoE quantization and the allocation of experts in host and device memory to support hardware constraints.\n\n### Experiments\nThe experiments evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, including the hit ratio for different cache sizes, recall for speculative loading, and the impact of mixed MoE quantization on model performance and size. The practical offloading performance of the MoE-based language model is also benchmarked across different hardware configurations.\n\n### Conclusion and Future Work\nThe proposed method offers a practical solution for running large MoE language models on resource-constricted hardware, demonstrating substantial improvements in generation speed compared to traditional approaches. Future work is planned to explore further offloading strategies based on speculative expert prediction.\n\n### Critique\nThe paper provides valuable insights into accelerating MoE language models on consumer hardware, but potential limitations and challenges that could be addressed include:\n- The evaluation focuses on a specific set of hardware configurations, and a broader test across diverse hardware setups could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed techniques' generalizability.\n- The study examines the proposed strategies in the context of MoE language models; however, a comparison with other offloading and acceleration techniques for LLMs could further validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.\n- While the provided results are promising, a deeper analysis of the trade-offs between model performance and acceleration techniques, especially in more complex language understanding tasks, could enhance the paper's impact and practical implications.", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17238v1", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2312.17238v1", "abs": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17238v1"}, "authors": ["Artyom Eliseev", "Denis Mazur"], "title": "Fast Inference of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models with Offloading", "subtitle": "Sparse Mixture-of-Experts language models run faster with parameter offloading strategies, enabling efficient use on consumer hardware.", "categories": ["architectures"], "publish_date": "2023-12-28", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "image": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2312.17238v1/x1.png", "word_count": 6493, "is_truncated": false}}

ZOE leverages low-bias inference and a master-slave alignment (MSA) module to collect and prune unsupervised responses and applies multi-objective optimization for fine-tuning. Experimental results show that ZOE outperforms existing methods in mitigating position biases for generative tasks, sacrificing only a small performance on biased samples.\n\n### Major Findings\n1. **ZOE** consistently outperforms existing methods in mitigating position biases for generative tasks without the need for external bias knowledge or non-biased samples.\n2.

The discrepancy in grammatical rules between natural language and code constraints search retrieval performance.\n2. The Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) framework showed limited improvement due to the significant stylistic difference between exemplar code and true code. \n3. The proposed **Rewrites the Code (ReCo)** method significantly improved retrieval accuracy for both sparse and dense retrieval systems across diverse search scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of style normalization in code search.\n\n### Introduction\n- Traditional code search methods suffer from vocabulary mismatch problems due to the grammatical discrepancy between programming languages and natural languages. Dense retrieval systems offer potential semantic connections but struggle with rare terminological associations.\n- The paper proposes the Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) framework, where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate exemplar code snippets to augment natural language queries for code search. However, LLM-augmented GAR showed limited performance improvement due to stylistic deviations between generated and true code snippets.\n\n### Methodology\n- **ReCo:** The paper introduces a method that not only generates exemplar codes based on the query but also rewrites the codes in the codebase. This process involves summarizing the code into a natural language description and then using this description to generate a rewritten code that aligns with the exemplar code's style. Experimental results demonstrated significant retrieval accuracy improvements with ReCo across various search scenarios.\n\n### Code Style Similarity\n- The paper proposes a novel evaluation metric, **Code Style Similarity (CSSim)**, to quantify the disparity in code style. This metric evaluates style from three dimensions: variable naming, API invocation, and code structure, based on edit distance. Empirical findings revealed superior explanatory power of CSSim in measuring the style deviation of code compared to existing metrics.\n\n### Experimental Setups\n- The paper evaluated ReCo across various search scenarios and programming languages, demonstrating its effectiveness in boosting retrieval performance. Comparison among evaluation metrics, impact of LLMs, and the number of generated codes were investigated to validate the superiority of CSSim and the effectiveness of ReCo.\n\n### Discussion\n- The paper highlights the potential impact of ReCo on various code-related tasks and proposes future work to develop specific models for code style normalization. The authors intend to train models to improve the efficiency of ReCo in practical applications.\n\n### Critique\nThe paper's approach in introducing ReCo and CSSim is innovative and addresses a significant limitation in code search with LLM-augmented methods. However, the experimental results are limited to simulated settings, and the real-world impact of ReCo in production systems needs to be further explored. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a deeper discussion on potential drawbacks or limitations of the ReCo method, as well as considerations for efficiency and scalability in real-time search systems.", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04514v1", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2401.04514v1", "abs": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04514v1"}, "authors": ["Haochen Li", "Xin Zhou", "Zhiqi Shen"], "title": "Rewriting the Code: A Simple Method for Large Language Model Augmented Code Search", "subtitle": "Code search improved by ReCo for style normalization, boosting retrieval accuracy with new metric.", "categories": ["architectures", "programming", "production"], "publish_date": "2024-01-09", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "image": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2401.04514v1/x1.png", "word_count": 8696, "is_truncated": false}}

It treats Med-VQA as a generative task, unlike previous methods that treat it as an answer classification task, leading to improved performance in practical application scenarios.\n\n2. The framework includes a **Joint Text-Multimodal encoder** and a method called **Transfer and Caption (TransCap)** that extends the feature space of single-modal image datasets using large language models (LLMs).\n\n3. Experiments show that the method achieves excellent results with fewer multimodal datasets, indicating the advantages of generative VQA models.\n\n### Introduction\nMedical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that requires deeper and more accurate understanding of medical images compared to VQA of natural images. Due to privacy concerns and expensive annotation processes, large-scale datasets for training are scarce, making Med-VQA a highly challenging task.\n\n### Related Work\nEarly works used RNNs and CNNs to extract textual and visual features for Med-VQA tasks. The emergence of transformers has enabled the migration of large-scale pretraining from the textual domain to the multimodal domain. Previous works have treated VQA as a classification or rank task, limiting their effectiveness in practical application scenarios. The paper proposes a new pretraining and fine-tuning paradigm, treating VQA as a generative task.\n\n### Method\nThe proposed framework includes a Joint Text-Multimodal encoder and a method called Transfer and Caption (TransCap) for constructing multimodal medical data based on unimodal image datasets. The framework adopts the pretraining and finetuning paradigm, utilizing tasks like Image-Text Contrastive Learning (ITC), Image-Text Matching (ITM), and Mask Language Modeling (MLM) for multi-modal pretraining. The paper details the model architecture, pretraining process, TransCap method, and VQA finetuning.\n\n### Experiment\nThe paper compares the proposed framework with existing approaches on VQA-RAD and Slake datasets, demonstrating improved performance in both open-ended and closed-ended questions. Ablation studies show the impact of different components of the framework, indicating the effectiveness of the Joint Text-Multimodal encoder and the positive effect of TransCap on VQA performance.\n\n### Critique\nThe proposed framework demonstrates promising results, especially in terms of treating Med-VQA as a generative task and the novel TransCap method for constructing multimodal medical data. However, the paper lacks a discussion on potential limitations or challenges in implementing the proposed framework in real-world scenarios.

The dataset comprises of two subtasks: generation and verification, with additional metalinguistic non-self-reference examples for control testing.\n\n2. The dataset was hand-crafted by experts and validated by non-expert annotators. Testing several open-source and closed-source language models, the study found that all models performed close to chance across both subtasks and even on the non-self-referential metalinguistic control data. GPT 4 was the only model that consistently performed significantly better than chance, though it still only scored in the 60% range, while untrained human annotators scored in the 89\u201393% range.\n\n3. The findings suggest that current language models struggle with understanding and generating self-referential and metalinguistic language, with limited evidence of improvement with model scale. This poses a serious challenge for even the best present-day models.\n\n#### I. Introduction\n- Self-reference, especially metalinguistic self-reference, plays a crucial role in various domains and is considered a key aspect of higher intelligence or consciousness in philosophy. Humans generally have no trouble with metalinguistic language, which involves reasoning about metalinguistic properties and resolving self-reference.\n\n#### II. Related Work\n- The paper presents \"I am a Strange Dataset\" as the first AI challenge dataset targeting metalinguistics. It also discusses previous work on self-reference with language models, focusing on models' ability to improve on themselves or their outputs.\n\n#### III. I am a Strange Dataset\n- The dataset is constructed to test whether language models can produce and understand self-referential and metalinguistic statements. It includes self-referential statements and non-self-referential metalinguistic problem categories. The dataset is comprised of 208 examples, and an additional 10 \"Impossible Dataset\" examples that experts struggled to understand.\n\n##### A. Tags\n- The dataset includes 10 tags to categorize examples, capturing different aspects of the mental facilities required to solve the problems.\n\n##### B. Metrics\n- The study focuses on testing whether models can generate and understand self-referential and metalinguistic statements, presenting several metrics for generation and validation.\n\n##### C. Non-Self-Referential Control\n- The study compares the performance of models on non-self-referent examples to the original self-referential examples.\n\n#### IV. Human Experiment Details\n- A human baseline is established from annotations by Mechanical Turk workers, demonstrating that humans perform significantly better than language models on the task.\n\n#### V. Results\n- Language models perform close to the level of chance on the \"I am a Strange Dataset.\" GPT 4 is the only model to achieve scores significantly above random, but still below human performance. Models also struggle with non-self-referential metalinguistic aspects, and there is limited evidence that GPT 4 struggles more with self-referential metalinguistic problems than non-self-referential problems. Model performance improves with scale.\n\n#### VI. Conclusion\n- The dataset presents a serious challenge for language models, indicating that self-referential language is particularly difficult for them. The findings suggest that scale beyond 70B parameters may be needed for comparable performance from models.\n\n### Critique\n- The study does not delve into potential solutions or improvements for language models to better handle metalinguistic self-reference. There may also be limitations in the study's evaluation methodology and dataset design that could be explored further. Additionally, the impact of different tokenizers and limitations imposed by training data were only briefly discussed and could be areas for deeper investigation.", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05300v1", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2401.05300v1", "abs": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05300v1"}, "authors": ["Tristan Thrush", "Jared Moore", "Miguel Monares", "Christopher Potts", "Douwe Kiela"], "title": "I am a Strange Dataset: Metalinguistic Tests for Language Models", "subtitle": "New dataset I am a Strange Dataset tests large language models in metalinguistic tasks, with mixed results.", "categories": ["production", "architectures"], "publish_date": "2024-01-10", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "image": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2401.05300v1/extracted/5340562/robotexplode.png", "word_count": 9407, "is_truncated": false}}

They compare AMIE's performance to that of primary care physicians (PCPs) in a study of text-based consultations with simulated patient actors. The study finds that AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on several axes according to specialist physicians and patient actors. The evaluation framework encompasses history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication skills, and empathy. Additionally, the authors detail the datasets used to develop AMIE, including medical reasoning, long-form medical question answering, medical summarization, and real-world dialogue datasets. They describe a simulated learning environment for diagnostic dialogues, a self-play framework for iterative improvement, instruction fine-tuning, and a chain-of-reasoning strategy for online inference.\n\n### Major Findings\n1. The AI system, AMIE, showed greater **diagnostic accuracy** and **superior performance** in multiple axes compared to primary care physicians in simulated text-based consultations.\n2. AMIE was able to achieve higher conversation quality by surpassing PCPs in patient actor and specialist physician evaluations for various axes, including communication skills and empathy.\n3. The study introduced a novel self-play environment for learning, and a chain-of-reasoning strategy for online inference, which significantly contributed to AMIE's performance and capabilities.\n\n### Methods and Results\n#### AMIE: An LLM based AI System for Diagnostic Dialogue\n- The authors used diverse real-world datasets for training AMIE, including medical reasoning, long-form medical question answering, medical summarization, and real-world dialogue datasets.\n- They developed a simulated dialogue learning environment with a self-play framework for iterative improvement, an instruction fine-tuning process, and a chain-of-reasoning strategy for online inference.\n\n#### Objective Structured Clinical Examination \n- The study involved 20 PCPs and 20 validated patient actors in a randomized, double-blind crossover study with 149 case scenarios.\n- AMIE's consultations outperformed PCPs in terms of **conversation quality** across multiple axes, as assessed by both patient actors and specialist physicians.\n\n### Critique\nThe study has several limitations, including the use of a text-chat interface, which may not be representative of usual clinical consultation settings. The simulated patient actors may not fully reflect the complexity and nuances of real patients, and the study design may not fully capture the challenges of real-world clinical dialogue. Future research should aim to address these limitations and further validate AMIE's performance in real-world clinical practice.\n\nOverall, the paper contributes to the development of conversational diagnostic AI systems and highlights the potential of AI in improving the quality and accuracy of medical consultations. However, it is important to consider the limitations and contextual factors related to the study design and evaluation.

To alleviate this burden, they introduce SpecGen, a novel technique for formal program specification generation based on Large Language Models (LLMs). SpecGen aims to leverage LLMs' code comprehension capabilities to overcome the limitations of existing methods. The process of SpecGen consists of two phases: the conversational approach, which guides the LLM to generate appropriate specifications, and the mutation-based approach, which applies mutation operators to model-generated specifications and employs a heuristic selection strategy to obtain verified specifications. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of SpecGen using a dataset of 120 Java programs. The experimental results demonstrate that SpecGen outperforms existing approaches in generating verifiable specifications for complex programs by achieving a success rate of 100 out of 120 programs.\n\n### **Major Findings:**\n1. SpecGen successfully generated verifiable specifications for 100 out of 120 Java programs, outperforming existing purely LLM-based approaches and conventional specification generation tools like Houdini and Daikon.\n2. The conversational approach effectively guides LLMs to generate accurate and comprehensive specifications, which contributes to the improvement of success probability.\n3. Mutation-based specification generation, coupled with a heuristic selection strategy, significantly improves the efficiency of generating and verifying specifications, particularly for complex programs with loop structures.\n\n### **Analysis and Critique:**\nThe article presents an innovative approach, SpecGen, that addresses the challenges of manual formal program specification generation by leveraging Large Language Models. The use of LLMs to automate the generation of formal program specifications represents a significant advancement in the field of software engineering. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SpecGen in generating accurate and comprehensive specifications for complex Java programs. However, the article could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of potential limitations or challenges associated with the use of LLMs in program specification generation. One potential challenge is the interpretability and explainability of the specifications generated by LLMs, which could be crucial for ensuring trustworthiness and usability in practical software development scenarios.

{"id": "2401.13275v1", "text": "### Summary of the Article:\n\nIn this article, the authors investigated whether AI assistants based on large language models (LLMs) can be aware of and express what they do not know through natural language. They proposed a method to align AI assistants with model-specific \"I don't know\" (Idk) datasets containing known and unknown questions, aiming to teach the assistants to refuse to answer questions they do not know. The study conducted experiments using various alignment methods, including Idk-Prompting, Idk Supervised Fine-tuning, and Preference-aware Optimization, to explore their effectiveness in teaching AI assistants to acknowledge their unknowns. The investigation utilized the TriviaQA dataset for constructing the Idk dataset and conducting evaluations. The findings indicated that after aligning with Idk datasets, AI assistants could largely know what they know and refuse to answer their unknown questions. Additionally, the experiments showed that preference-aware optimization methods mitigated the problem of incorrectly rejecting known questions caused by supervised fine-tuning.\n\n### Major Findings:\n1. After aligning using Idk datasets, AI assistants are capable of largely knowing what they know and what they do not know and refusing their unknown questions. Llama-2-7b-chat can definitively determine whether it knows the answer to up to 78.96% of the questions in the test set and exhibits good performance on out-of-distribution test sets.\n2. Supervised fine-tuning caused the model to become overly conservative, incorrectly rejecting known questions. Preference-aware optimization can mitigate this problem, promoting the overall proportion of Ik-Ik and Ik-Idk questions.\n3. The Ik threshold used to define known and unknowns questions influences the behavior of the assistant. The higher the Ik threshold, the greater the total number of Ik-Ik and Ik-Idk questions, resulting in a more truthful assistant.\n4. Larger models are more adept at distinguishing which questions they know and which they don\u2019t know. The use of Idk-SFT on Llama-2-70b-chat, as compared to Llama-2-7b-chat, results in a 5.8% improvement in the total number of Ik-Ik and Ik-Idk questions.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\nThe article provides valuable insights into the question of whether AI assistants can be aware of their own limitations and refuse to answer questions they do not know. The authors carefully designed experiments and proposed alignment methods that demonstrated the potential for AI assistants to acknowledge and express unknowns. However, the study focused mainly on alignment methods and their impact, overlooking potential biases in the experimental setup or discrepancies in the TriviaQA dataset utilized for constructing Idk datasets. Additionally, while the findings are promising, the article lacks a broader discussion of the ethical and practical implications of AI assistants refusing to answer questions. This critical analysis highlights the need to consider the broader context and application of the findings in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, exploring the impact of human-AI interaction and potential user perceptions when AI assistants refuse to provide answers could further enhance the article's relevance and significance.", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13275v1", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2401.13275v1", "abs": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13275v1"}, "authors": ["Qinyuan Cheng", "Tianxiang Sun", "Xiangyang Liu", "Wenwei Zhang", "Zhangyue Yin", "Shimin Li", "Linyang Li", "Kai Chen", "Xipeng Qiu"], "title": "Can AI Assistants Know What They Don't Know?", "subtitle": "AI assistants based on large language models can perform tasks well, but still make errors.

The study conducted a large-scale experiment with over 800 participants from 40+ countries to evaluate the effects of exposure to AI-generated ideas, varying the exposure levels and whether the examples were labeled as AI. The findings revealed that high exposure to AI ideas increased the collective diversity of ideas without affecting individual creativity. Additionally, the study found that disclosing ideas as coming from AI did not significantly moderate the effect of AI exposure. The authors also observed that individuals identifying as highly creative were less influenced by AI disclosure, and participants were more likely to adopt AI ideas for difficult creative tasks. Overall, the introduction of AI ideas into society was suggested to potentially yield more diverse but not necessarily better human ideas.\n\n### Major Findings:\n1. **High AI Exposure and Collective Diversity**: The study reported that high exposure to AI-generated ideas increased the average amount and rate of change of collective idea diversity. However, it did not affect the creativity of individual ideas, suggesting that AI made ideas different, not better.\n\n2. **Impact on Diversity Evolution**: The research revealed that high AI exposure increased the speed at which idea diversity developed. The study detected a consequential increase in the rate of change in idea diversity for conditions with high AI exposure, indicating a substantial impact on the evolution of idea diversity over time.\n\n3. **Influence of AI Disclosure and Task Difficulty**: The findings indicated that self-reported creative individuals were less influenced by AI disclosure. Moreover, participants were more likely to adopt AI ideas for difficult creative tasks, suggesting that users rely on AI ideas more for challenging prompts.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\nThe study provides valuable insights into the impact of AI-generated ideas on human creativity and diversity. However, several aspects warrant critical consideration:\n\n1. **Limited Impact on Individual Creativity**: Although the study found an increase in collective diversity, the observation that high AI exposure did not affect individual creativity raises questions about the overall effectiveness of AI-generated ideas in enhancing creative output at an individual level.\n\n2. **Generalization and External Validity**: While the large-scale experiment captured diverse perspectives, the generalizability of the findings to real-world settings and diverse cultural contexts warrants further scrutiny. The extent to which the experiment's findings mirror real-world creativity and idea generation necessitates careful consideration.\n\n3. **Subjective Nature of Creativity Measurement**: The study primarily focused on measuring creativity using a classifier, which raises concerns about the subjective nature of creativity assessment. The reliance on a single dimension of creativity and the exclusion of other creative dimensions may limit the comprehensiveness of the findings.\n\nIn conclusion, while the research contributes significantly to understanding the implications of AI-generated ideas on human creativity and diversity, further research is essential to address these limitations and enhance the robustness and applicability of the findings.\n\n**Overall, the article presents noteworthy evidence of the impact of exposure to AI-generated ideas on human creativity and diversity, emphasizing the need for continued research to advance our understanding of AI's influence on societal idea generation.**", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13481v1", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2401.13481v1", "abs": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13481v1"}, "authors": ["Joshua Ashkinaze", "Julia Mendelsohn", "Li Qiwei", "Ceren Budak", "Eric Gilbert"], "title": "How AI Ideas Affect the Creativity, Diversity, and Evolution of Human Ideas: Evidence From a Large, Dynamic Experiment", "subtitle": "Exposure to AI-generated ideas increases collective diversity, but not individual creativity.
