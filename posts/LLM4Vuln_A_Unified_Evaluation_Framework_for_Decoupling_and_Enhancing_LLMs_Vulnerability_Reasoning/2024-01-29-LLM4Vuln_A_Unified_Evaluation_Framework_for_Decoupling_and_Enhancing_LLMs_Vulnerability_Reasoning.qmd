### Summary:
The article introduces the LLM4Vuln framework, which aims to evaluate and enhance the vulnerability reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). It includes four pluggable components: Knowledge Retrieval, Tool Invocation, Prompt Schemes, and Instruction Following. The framework decouples LLMs' vulnerability reasoning from their other capabilities and evaluates how their vulnerability reasoning could be enhanced when combined with the enhancement of other capabilities. The article also discusses the effects of different prompt schemes on LLMs' vulnerability reasoning and the performance of open-source models in detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Additionally, it provides a list of references to academic papers and reports related to security audit findings, vulnerability detection, and large language models.

### Major Findings:
1. The LLM4Vuln framework provides a systematic approach to evaluating and enhancing LLMs' vulnerability reasoning capability, addressing the challenges of incorporating up-to-date vulnerability knowledge and improving instruction-following for structured output.
2. The choice of prompt scheme has a significant impact on LLMs' vulnerability reasoning, with the Pre-CoT prompt scheme improving precision but not consistently impacting recall improvement, and the Post-CoT prompt scheme indirectly leading to an increase in both true positives and false positives.
3. The successful testing of new projects for zero-day vulnerabilities using LLM4Vuln demonstrates its effectiveness, emphasizing the importance of knowledge supplementation in vulnerability detection.

### Analysis and Critique:
The LLM4Vuln framework has the potential to advance the effectiveness of LLMs in vulnerability detection and has practical implications for real-world security applications. However, the use of original vulnerability reports as knowledge may not be as effective in enhancing LLMs' vulnerability reasoning. The choice of prompt scheme plays a crucial role in influencing the performance of LLMs in vulnerability detection. The article provides valuable insights into the performance of open-source models in detecting vulnerabilities, highlighting the need for reasoning ability in these models. The section on references offers a comprehensive list of resources for researchers and practitioners in the field of cybersecurity and language model applications. The prompts for summarizing vulnerabilities and their root causes provide a structured approach to analyzing and reporting vulnerabilities, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing the security and integrity of systems handling valuable data and assets.
