# Summary of “GPT-4V(ision) as a Generalist Web Agent, if Grounded”

## Major Takeaways
- **LMMs** like GPT-4V have great potential as **generalist web agents**, outperforming text-only LLMs like GPT-4 and smaller models specifically fine-tuned for web agents in completing tasks on live websites.
- Grounding, especially **element grounding**, remains a substantial challenge, with the best strategies still exhibiting a performance gap with oracle grounding. **Grounding via textual choices** was the most effective approach, outperforming image annotation strategies, but still faced challenges with identical elements on webpages.
- **In-context learning (ICL)** with large models showed better generalization to unseen websites compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods, making it a more compelling solution for generalist web agents, especially in scenarios lacking annotations or requiring strong generalization capabilities.

## Introduction
The paper explores the potential of LMMs as generalist web agents, defining generalist web agents as those that can follow natural language instructions and complete tasks on any real-world website.

## SeeAct
- Aims to investigate the capabilities of **GPT-4V** as a generalist web agent by generating action descriptions and identifying webpage elements for completing tasks on websites.
- Formulation includes two essential capabilities: **Action Generation** and **Element Grounding** for identifying HTML elements at each step.

## Experiments
- **Dataset**: Evaluated on the **Mind2Web** benchmark, encompassing over 2,000 tasks on real-world websites.
- **Methods**: SeeAct, baselines such as FLAN-T5 and BLIP2-T5, and in-context learning methods using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are compared.
- **Offline Evaluation**: Shows potential of GPT-4V as a web agent with **oracle grounding** method achieving notable success rates, but still exhibiting a substantial gap with proposed strategies. In-context learning methods demonstrate better generalization to unseen websites compared to supervised fine-tuning methods.
- **Online Evaluation**: Demonstrates a substantial discrepancy with offline evaluations, indicating that multiple viable plans for the same task impact model performance.

## Results and Analysis
- **Whole Task Success Rate**: SeeActChoice outperforms existing methods on live websites, showcasing its potential as a generalist web agent. Surpassed fine-tuned models like FLAN-T5-XL in online evaluation, despite showing lower step success rates in offline evaluation.
- **Error Analysis**: Showed challenges in grounding via textual choices and image annotation, with challenges of identical elements and hallucination errors.
- **Knowledge and Reasoning**: Tasks requiring knowledge and reasoning displayed GPT-4V's capabilities in identifying specific details like IATA codes and geographic locations.
- **Path Variation and Error Correction**: Demonstrates the model’s flexibility in finding alternative paths to task completion and awareness of error correction during the task.

## Critique
- The major findings are promising, but the discrepancy between offline and online evaluations raises questions about the robustness of the evaluation protocols and the need for better alignment between the two.
- The focus on the specific dataset Mind2Web and the limited subset used for experiments may limit the generalizability of the findings.

Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the potential of large multimodal models as generalist web agents and highlights the challenges and future research directions in this domain. It opens up discussions on the practical implications and ethical considerations of deploying such models in real-world web environments.
