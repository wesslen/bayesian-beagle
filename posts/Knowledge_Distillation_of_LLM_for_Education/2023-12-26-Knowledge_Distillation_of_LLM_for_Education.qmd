# Knowledge Distillation of LLM for Education

## Major Takeaways

- The study proposes a method for **distilling the knowledge of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient, and accurate neural networks** for deployment in resource-constrained educational environments.
- The **knowledge transfer is achieved through a specialized loss function tailored to learn from the LLM’s output probabilities**, ensuring that the student model closely mimics the teacher’s performance.
- Results demonstrate that the **distilled student models have comparable accuracy to the teacher model for the 7T dataset**, and significantly higher accuracy than original neural network models for other datasets.

## Introduction
The use of **Large Language Models (LLMs) in education**, particularly for automatic scoring, is discussed, highlighting their potential impact on classroom assessment practices and adaptive learning systems. The deployment of these models in educational settings is constrained by their considerable size and computational requirements, which presents a challenge for widespread adoption in resource-constrained educational environments.
