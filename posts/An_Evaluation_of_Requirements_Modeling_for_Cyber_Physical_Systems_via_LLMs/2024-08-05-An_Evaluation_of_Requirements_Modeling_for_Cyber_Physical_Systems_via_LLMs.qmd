**Summary:**

This paper evaluates the performance of large language models (LLMs) in modeling cyber-physical systems (CPSs) requirements using problem diagrams. The authors propose a benchmark called CPSBench, which consists of 12 enterprise-level requirements documents and 30 tutorial cases. They apply a few-shot reasoning strategy to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of seven advanced LLMs. The evaluation reveals that LLMs have limited effectiveness in modeling CPSs requirements using problem diagrams for practical applications, with a recall rate of only around 60%. LLMs have a better understanding of general requirements concepts than specialized concepts, and their performance can be improved with more shots in the prompt. The authors also establish a taxonomy of LLMs hallucinations in CPSs requirements modeling.

**Major Findings:**

1. LLMs have limited ability to model the requirements for CPSs using problem diagrams, with a recall rate of only around 60%.
2. LLMs have a better understanding of general concepts than specialized concepts in CPSs requirements modeling.
3. LLMs can improve their performance with more shots in the prompt.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in CPSs requirements modeling using problem diagrams. However, the evaluation is limited to seven advanced LLMs, and the results may not generalize to other LLMs. Additionally, the authors do not discuss the potential impact of the quality and complexity of the requirements documents on the performance of LLMs. The paper also does not provide a detailed comparison of the performance of LLMs with other approaches for CPSs requirements modeling. Finally, the authors do not discuss the potential ethical implications of using LLMs for CPSs requirements modeling, such as the risk of introducing biases or errors in the requirements.
