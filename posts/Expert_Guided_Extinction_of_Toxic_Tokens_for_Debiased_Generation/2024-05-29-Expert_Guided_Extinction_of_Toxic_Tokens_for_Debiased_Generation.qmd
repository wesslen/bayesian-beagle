### Summary:

The paper proposes a novel approach called "exposed" to eliminate undesired harmful outputs in large language models (LLMs) without the need for extensive unbiased corpus or meticulously curated instructions. The method constructs a debiasing expert based on a toxic corpus to expose and elicit potentially dangerous tokens, which are then processed by the LLMs to construct a fair distribution by suppressing and attenuating the toxic tokens. The proposed method is evaluated on fairness benchmarks over three LLM families and is shown to significantly reduce potential social bias while balancing fairness and generation performance.

### Major Findings:

1. The proposed method, "exposed," constructs a debiasing expert based on a toxic corpus to expose and elicit potentially dangerous tokens, which are then processed by the LLMs to construct a fair distribution by suppressing and attenuating the toxic tokens.
2. The method is evaluated on fairness benchmarks over three LLM families and is shown to significantly reduce potential social bias while balancing fairness and generation performance.
3. The proposed method does not require extensive unbiased corpus or meticulously curated instructions, making it a more efficient and scalable solution for debiasing LLMs.

### Analysis and Critique:

The proposed method, "exposed," presents a promising approach to debiasing LLMs by constructing a debiasing expert based on a toxic corpus. The method is shown to significantly reduce potential social bias while balancing fairness and generation performance. However, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed method. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential impact of the proposed method on the overall performance and accuracy of the LLMs. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of the proposed method in different contexts and applications.
