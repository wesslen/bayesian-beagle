# Summary:

**Summary:**
The paper introduces a novel training-free diffusion framework called Complex Diffusion (CxD) for complex scene generation. Inspired by the artist's painting process, CxD divides the process into three stages: composition, painting, and retouching. The method leverages the chain-of-thought capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to decompose complex prompts based on Complex Decomposition Criteria (CDC) and manage composition and layout. An attention modulation method is developed to guide simple prompts to specific regions, and a retouching model is used to enhance image details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CxD outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-quality, semantically consistent, and visually diverse images for complex scenes.

**Major Findings:**
1. The paper provides a clear definition of complex scenes and introduces Complex Decomposition Criteria (CDC) to effectively manage complex prompts.
2. The CxD framework, inspired by the artistic creation process, divides the generation of complex scene images into three stages: composition, painting, and retouching.
3. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CxD generates high-quality, consistent, and diverse images of complex scenes, even when dealing with intricate prompts.

**Analysis and Critique:**
- The paper effectively addresses the challenges of complex scene generation by providing a clear definition and criteria for managing complex prompts.
- The CxD framework, which mirrors the artist's drawing process, is a novel approach to generating complex scene images.
- The use of LLMs for composition and layout generation, as well as the attention modulation method, are innovative solutions to the challenges of complex scene generation.
- The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the CxD framework in generating high-quality, semantically consistent, and visually diverse images for complex scenes.
- However, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations or shortcomings of the CxD framework, such as the computational cost or the potential for overfitting to specific types of complex scenes.
- Additionally, the paper does not provide a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for complex scene generation, which could further validate the effectiveness of the CxD framework.
