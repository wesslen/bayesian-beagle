  <title>KIVI: A Tuning-Free Asymmetric 2bit Quantization for KV Cache</title>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) requires batching many requests together to reduce the cost per request. Yet, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores attention keys and values to avoid re-computations, significantly increases memory demands and becomes the new bottleneck in speed and memory usage. This memory demand increases with larger batch sizes and longer context lengths. Additionally, the inference speed is limited by the size of KV cache, as the GPU’s SRAM must load the entire KV cache from the main GPU memory for each token generated, causing the computational core to be idle during this process.</li>
<li>A straightforward and effective solution to reduce KV cache size is quantization, which decreases the total bytes taken by KV cache. However, there is a lack of in-depth studies that explore the element distribution of KV cache to understand the hardness and limitation of KV cache quantization. To fill the gap, the authors conducted a comprehensive study on the element distribution in KV cache of popular LLMs. Their findings indicate that the key cache should be quantized per-channel, i.e., group elements along the channel dimension and quantize them together. In contrast, the value cache should be quantized per-token.</li>
<li>Based on the above insights, the authors proposed KIVI, a plug-and-play extreme low-bit KV cache quantization method. KIVI quantizes key cache per-channel and quantizes value cache per-token. The per-token value cache quantization aligns well with the streaming nature of auto-regressive inference, allowing newly quantized tensors to be directly appended to the existing quantized value cache by token dimension.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<p>In this paper, the authors introduce a Bayesian learning model to understand the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). They explore the optimization metric of LLMs, which is based on predicting the next token, and develop a novel model grounded in this principle. The authors construct an ideal generative text model represented by a multinomial transition probability matrix with a prior, and examine how LLMs approximate this matrix. They discuss the continuity of the mapping between embeddings and multinomial distributions, and present the Dirichlet approximation theorem to approximate any prior. Additionally, they demonstrate how text generation by LLMs aligns with Bayesian learning principles and delve into the implications for in-context learning, specifically explaining why in-context learning emerges in larger models where prompts are considered as samples to be updated. The findings indicate that the behavior of LLMs is consistent with Bayesian Learning, offering new insights into their functioning and potential applications.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary"><strong>Summary:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Large language models (LLMs) have been used for sequential decision making in interactive environments, but leveraging environment reward signals for continual LLM actor improvement is challenging.</li>
<li>Skill Set Optimization (SSO) is proposed for improving LLM actor performance through constructing and refining sets of transferable skills. SSO constructs skills by extracting common subtrajectories with high rewards and generating subgoals and instructions to represent each skill. These skills are provided to the LLM actor in-context to reinforce behaviors with high rewards. Then, SSO further refines the skill set by pruning skills that do not continue to result in high rewards.</li>
<li>SSO outperforms baselines by 40% in a custom NetHack task and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in ScienceWorld by 35%.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="major-findings" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="major-findings">Major Findings:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Large Language Model (LLM) actors have been deployed in interactive domains such as robotics, games, and programming. However, finetuning an LLM actor directly using a traditional RL policy gradient is impractical with contemporary LLMs and impossible with black-box closed-source LLMs. Instead, a new paradigm of in-context policy improvement is explored.</li>
<li>In natural language processing (NLP) tasks, in-context learning improves task performance by editing LLM inputs with instructions, task examples, or auxiliary tasks. However, naively applying these techniques to interactive domains generalizes poorly between tasks and does not scale well. Interactive domains require sequential decision making with long trajectories of actions and complex credit assignment.</li>
<li>Skill Set Optimization (SSO) is proposed for automatically constructing skills for in-context policy improvement, where a skill is a list of instructions for reaching a subgoal. SSO takes inspiration from both in-context learning and policy optimization to optimize a set of skills for in-context policy improvement.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-and-critique">Analysis and Critique:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The proposed Skill Set Optimization (SSO) method demonstrates significant improvements in LLM actor performance, outperforming baselines in both custom NetHack and ScienceWorld tasks.</li>
<li>The SSO method effectively constructs and refines transferable skills, providing a promising approach for continual learning and policy improvement in interactive environments.</li>
<li>However, the limitations of SSO include the reliance on similarity-based extraction for skill construction, which may be less effective in environments with distracting state information or low-level actions. Additionally, the method does not include a mechanism for leveraging negative environment feedback outside skill set refinement.</li>
<li>Overall, the SSO method represents a significant advancement in the field of in-context policy optimization for LLM actors, but further research is needed to address its limitations and enhance its effectiveness.</li>
