### Summary:

This paper investigates the impact of assigning personas to large language models (LLMs) on various aspects of their behavior. The study includes seven LLMs and 162 personas from 12 categories, such as gender, sexual orientation, and occupation. The models are prompted to answer questions from five datasets covering objective and subjective tasks. The results show that personas exhibit greater variability than the control setting and that some measures of persona behavior generalize across models.

### Major Findings:

1. Personas significantly affect task performance, with some personas showing striking performance differences, such as a 20 percentage point gap between the top and bottom personas in TruthfulQA for GPT-3.5.
2. Some persona rankings are consistent across models, with asexual person and person of atheism belief being consistently accurate for TruthfulQA, and education personas' accuracy being sorted by education level for MMLU.
3. Expert personas are not always the best option for tasks requiring their expertise, as they can come at a cost to overall performance and the benefit can be unreliable.
4. Personas significantly affect biases and unknown frequencies, with some personas exhibiting quite different unknown frequencies and often not being able to shift models between the too reckless region and the overly cautious region.
5. Personas exhibit lower bias against their own group than they do in the average case, but they are also less accurate in cases involving their demographic.
6. Personas significantly impact models' attitude scores in most cases, with regular personas having more diverse behaviors than control personas.
7. Personas' attitude associations relate to those of humans, but persona behavior is less nuanced than those of humans.
8. LLM refusals are arbitrary and potentially discriminatory, with some models refusing to adopt certain personas at higher rates than others.

### Analysis and Critique:

The study provides valuable insights into the impact of personas on LLM behavior, but there are some limitations and areas for further research. The study does not investigate the impact of personas on other aspects of LLM behavior, such as creativity or collaboration. Additionally, the study does not explore the potential for personas to be used to address ethical concerns, such as bias and fairness. Finally, the study does not consider the potential for personas to be used to
