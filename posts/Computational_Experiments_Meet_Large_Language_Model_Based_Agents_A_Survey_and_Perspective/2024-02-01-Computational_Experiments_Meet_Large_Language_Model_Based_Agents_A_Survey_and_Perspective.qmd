**Structured Summary of the Academic Article**

#### Overall Summary:
This article explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Agent-based Modeling (ABM) to enhance the representation of real social systems in simulations. The paper proposes LLM-based Agents, which can exhibit complex reasoning and autonomous learning, and discusses their potential application in social simulations. The article also highlights the challenges in using LLMs, such as the lack of explicit explainability, and the potential of combining computational experiments with LLM-based Agents for future research.

#### Major Findings:
1. **LLM-based Agents**: Integrating LLMs with ABM can lead to the development of LLM-based Agents, which can exhibit complex reasoning and autonomous learning, enhancing the representation of real social systems in simulations.
2. **Computational Experiments**: Combining computational experiments with LLM-
