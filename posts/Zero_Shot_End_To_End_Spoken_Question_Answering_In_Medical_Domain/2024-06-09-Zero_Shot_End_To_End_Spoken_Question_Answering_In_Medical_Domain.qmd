### Summary:

The paper introduces a novel end-to-end approach for zero-shot spoken question answering (SQA) in the medical domain, which outperforms traditional cascade systems. The proposed method, evaluated on a new open benchmark of 8 medical tasks and 48 hours of synthetic audio, requires up to 14.7 times fewer resources than a combined 1.3B parameters LLM with a 1.55B parameters ASR model while improving average accuracy by 0.5%. The study highlights the potential of end-to-end methodologies for SQA in resource-constrained contexts.

### Major Findings:

1. The proposed end-to-end approach for zero-shot SQA in the medical domain outperforms traditional cascade systems, requiring fewer resources and improving average accuracy.
2. The study introduces a new SQA dataset tailored to the medical domain and provides a zero-shot performance comparison of 4 existing state-of-the-art end-to-end models.
3. The research offers an in-depth analysis of the disposition of the information required for the SQA task within speech encoder layers.

### Analysis and Critique:

* The paper's focus on the medical domain is commendable, as it addresses a critical area where accurate and efficient SQA systems are essential.
* The use of synthetic audio for the benchmark may limit the generalizability of the findings to real-world scenarios, as natural speech may contain more variability and complexity.
* The study does not address multilingual contexts, which could be a significant limitation in a global healthcare context.
* The simplification of task formulation may not capture the full complexity of human interaction dynamics, potentially limiting the applicability of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.
* The paper does not discuss the potential ethical implications of using synthetic speech data, which could be an important consideration in the development of SQA systems.
* The study could benefit from further exploration of the proposed method's performance in low-resource domains, such as healthcare, where accurate and efficient SQA systems are particularly needed.
