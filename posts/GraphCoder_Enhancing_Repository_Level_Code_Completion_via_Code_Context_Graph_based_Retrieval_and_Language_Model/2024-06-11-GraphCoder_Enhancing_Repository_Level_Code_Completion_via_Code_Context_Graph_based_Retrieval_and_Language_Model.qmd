### Summary:

The paper introduces GraphCoder, a retrieval-augmented code completion framework that leverages large language models' (LLMs) general code knowledge and repository-specific knowledge via a graph-based retrieval-generation process. GraphCoder captures the context of the completion target more accurately through a code context graph (CCG) that consists of control-flow, data- and control-dependence between code statements. This structured approach is more effective than the sequence-based context used in existing retrieval-augmented methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GraphCoder, with improvements in exact match (EM) for code and identifier match compared to baseline retrieval-augmented methods, while using less time and space.

### Major Findings:

1. GraphCoder is a retrieval-augmented code completion framework that leverages LLMs' general code knowledge and repository-specific knowledge via a graph-based retrieval-generation process.
2. GraphCoder captures the context of the completion target more accurately through a code context graph (CCG) that consists of control-flow, data- and control-dependence between code statements.
3. GraphCoder achieves higher exact match (EM) on average compared to baseline retrieval-augmented methods, with increases of 6.06 in code match and 6.23 in identifier match.
4. GraphCoder uses less time and space than baseline retrieval-augmented methods.

### Analysis and Critique:

GraphCoder presents a promising approach to repository-level code completion by leveraging both general and repository-specific knowledge. The use of a code context graph (CCG) to capture the context of the completion target more accurately is a significant improvement over existing retrieval-augmented methods that rely on sequence-based context. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GraphCoder, with improvements in exact match (EM) for code and identifier match compared to baseline methods.

However, there are some potential limitations and areas for further research. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of GraphCoder with other state-of-the-art code completion methods, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its performance. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the scalability of GraphCoder to larger code re
