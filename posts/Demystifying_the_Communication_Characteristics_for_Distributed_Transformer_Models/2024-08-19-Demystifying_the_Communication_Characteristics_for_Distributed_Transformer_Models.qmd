### Summary:

This paper examines the communication behavior of transformer models, focusing on how different parallelism schemes used in multi-node/multi-GPU Deep Learning (DL) Training communicate data in the context of transformers. The authors use GPT-based language models as a case study due to their ubiquity. They validate the empirical results obtained from their communication logs using analytical models. The analysis reveals a need to optimize small message point-to-point communication further, correlations between sequence length, per-GPU throughput, model size, and optimizations used, and where to potentially guide further optimizations in framework and HPC middleware design and optimization.

### Major Findings:

1. The study highlights the importance of optimizing small message point-to-point communication in transformer models.
2. Correlations between sequence length, per-GPU throughput, model size, and optimizations used are identified.
3. The analysis suggests potential areas for further optimizations in framework and HPC middleware design and optimization.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the communication behavior of transformer models, offering valuable insights into the optimization of small message point-to-point communication. However, the study could benefit from a more detailed examination of the impact of different parallelism schemes on the overall performance of transformer models. Additionally, the paper could explore the potential implications of the identified correlations between sequence length, per-GPU throughput, model size, and optimizations used on the design and optimization of transformer models. Lastly, the paper could discuss the potential limitations and biases in the analytical models used to validate the empirical results.
