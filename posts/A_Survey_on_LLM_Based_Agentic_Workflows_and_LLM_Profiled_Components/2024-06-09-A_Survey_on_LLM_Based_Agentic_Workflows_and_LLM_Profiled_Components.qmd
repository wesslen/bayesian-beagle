### Summary:

This survey explores the common workflows and LLM-Profiled Components (LMPCs) in the context of LLM-based agents. The focus is on understanding the roles of LLMs and the reusability of LMPCs, with the aim of facilitating the development and reproducibility of agentic workflows. The survey does not attempt to cover all components of LLM-based agents comprehensively but rather concentrates on the involvement of LLMs within agentic workflows.

### Major Findings:

1. The survey summarizes four task-agnostic LMPCs (actors, planners, evaluators, and dynamic models) and other task-dependent LMPCs (e.g., verbalizers).
2. All existing works, like ReAct, Reflexion, and Tree-of-Thoughts, are composed of these workflows and LMPCs, along with some specific non-LLM components.
3. The survey categorizes and details three types of modular workflows: policy-only workflows, search-based workflows, and feedback-learning workflows.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The survey does not cover all components of LLM-based agents comprehensively, which may limit the understanding of the complete picture of LLM-based agents.
2. The survey does not discuss the integration of peripheral components into agentic workflows, which is an important aspect of building complex agents.
3. The survey does not provide a detailed discussion on memory design in LLM-based agents, which is a crucial component for the long-term performance of the agents.
4. The survey does not provide a comprehensive review of the existing works on LLM-based agents, which may limit the understanding of the current state-of-the-art in this field.
5. The survey does not provide a detailed discussion on the limitations and challenges of LLM-based agents, which is important for guiding future research in this field.
