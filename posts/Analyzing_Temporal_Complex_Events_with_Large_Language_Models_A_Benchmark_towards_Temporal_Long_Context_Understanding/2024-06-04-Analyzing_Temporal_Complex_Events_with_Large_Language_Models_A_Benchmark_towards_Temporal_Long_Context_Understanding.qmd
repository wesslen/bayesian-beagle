### Summary:

The paper proposes a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract and analyze event chains within Temporal Complex Events (TCEs), characterized by key points and timestamps. The authors establish a benchmark, TCELongBench, to evaluate LLMs' proficiency in handling temporal dynamics and understanding extensive text. The benchmark comprises three tasks: reading comprehension, temporal sequencing, and future event forecasting. The study leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods and LLMs with long context windows to deal with lengthy TCE narratives. The findings indicate that models with suitable retrievers exhibit comparable performance with those utilizing long context windows.

### Major Findings:

1. LLMs can be used to extract the outlines and form event chains of TCEs, enabling a better understanding of complex events.
2. TCELongBench, a large-scale benchmark, is built to test the model's capability of temporal, long text understanding, consisting of three tasks: TLB-detail QA, TLB-order QA, and TLB-forecast QA.
3. Extensive experiments are conducted using LLMs leveraging RAG methods and LLMs with long context windows, revealing that while retrievers are crucial for RAG methods, their effectiveness is variable. Long-context models excel in managing long temporal sequences but may lead to inferior performance. Models equipped with apt retrievers can match the performance of those designed for long contexts.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper presents a well-structured and coherent approach to analyzing TCEs using LLMs, providing a valuable contribution to the field of complex event analysis.
2. The establishment of the TCELongBench benchmark is a significant step towards evaluating LLMs' proficiency in handling temporal dynamics and understanding extensive text.
3. The study's findings highlight the potential of LLMs in extracting event chains and outlines from TCEs, as well as the importance of suitable retrievers in RAG methods.
4. However, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations or biases in the data used for training the LLMs, which could impact the models' performance in handling TCEs.
5. The study could benefit from further
