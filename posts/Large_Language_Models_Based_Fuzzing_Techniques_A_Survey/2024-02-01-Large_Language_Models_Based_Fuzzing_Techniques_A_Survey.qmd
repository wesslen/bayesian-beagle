### **Summary:**
- Large Language Models (LLMs) have facilitated the application of fuzzing tests in software testing, demonstrating remarkable performance.
- This survey provides a systematic overview of the approaches that fuse LLMs and fuzzing tests for software testing, summarizing the state-of-the-art methods up until 2024.
- The survey explores the potential for widespread deployment and application of fuzzing test techniques generated by LLMs in the future.

### **Major Findings:**
1. **Introduction to LLMs and Fuzzing Test:**
   - LLMs have presented powerful performance in various fields, including software testing.
   - Fuzzing test has been widely employed since the late 19th century and holds an important position in software testing.
   - LLMs-based fuzzers have emerged, combining different large language models with fuzzing test techniques to develop new fuzzing test systems.

2. **Survey Contribution:**
   - The survey explores three research questions in the field of LLMs-based fuzzers, including the use of LLMs for fuzzing tests in AI and non-AI fields, the advantages of LLMs-based fuzzers compared with traditional fuzzers, and the future development trend of LLMs-based fuzzers.
   - The survey selects 14 core literature through predetermined criteria, manual screening, and snowballing methods, mainly dedicated to explaining and analyzing all literature on the combined application of fuzzing test and large language models.

3. **LLM Based Fuzzing Test Analysis:**
   - The application scope of fuzzing test is wide, and it has been deployed in many software industry domains to test the reliability and security of software.
   - LLMs-based fuzzers introduce large language model technology into prompt engineering and seed mutation to enhance the performance of fuzzing tests.
   - LLMs-based fuzzers exhibit higher API and code coverage, generate more efficient programs, find more complex errors, and increase automation compared to traditional fuzzers.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The survey provides valuable insights into the potential of LLMs-based fuzzing technology in advancing the field of software testing.
- However, there are potential challenges and limitations, including the quality of pre-training data, time-consuming nature of LLMs, the need for a universal evaluation framework for LLMs-based fuzzers, and the goal of achieving full automation in fuzzing tests.
- Future work should focus on addressing these challenges and further developing LLMs-based fuzzing technology to achieve more efficient, reliable, and automated fuzzing test methods.
