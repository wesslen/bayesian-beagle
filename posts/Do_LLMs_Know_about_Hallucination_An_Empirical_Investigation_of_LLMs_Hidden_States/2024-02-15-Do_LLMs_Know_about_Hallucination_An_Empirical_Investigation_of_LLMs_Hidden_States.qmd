The results of the statistical tests for the awareness score being greater than zero are presented in Table 3. Additionally, the difference in awareness scores between each pair of models is compared and the results are shown in Table 5.

The statistical significance of the awareness score being above zero for adversarial and non-adversarial samples individually is assessed and the results for each model are presented in Tables 6, 7, and 8.

The statistical test results for exploring different prompting strategies are reported in Tables 9 and 10.

The detailed regression results (projection value regressed on awareness score) are presented in Tables 11 and 12.

Furthermore, additional results related to the awareness score distributions across different models, prompting strategies, and the projection illustration are provided in Figures 9, 10, 11, and 12.

Lastly, a case study is conducted to explore the potential of leveraging guidance extracted from the LLMâ€™s hidden states to mitigate LLM hallucination. Selected samples where the adjusted response (by adding the offset) better aligns with the ground truth compared to the original response (without the offset) are presented in Table 13.
