**Summary:**
Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) have evolved to be integral to daily tasks and human-computer interaction. Trust and reliance are essential factors in user interaction with CUIs, yet they remain understudied. This workshop aims to unite researchers to explore trust within CUIs and address the lack of research in this area. The complexity of trust in CUIs stems from diverse manifestations, potential consequences of overtrust and undertrust, and the need for transparent and ethical design strategies.

### Major Findings:
1. **Importance of Trust in CUIs**
    - Trust is crucial for the accuracy and reliability of information and services in CUI interactions.
    - The establishment of trust influences user comfort in sharing personal data and forging connections with AI-powered systems.

2. **Complex Nature of Trust**
    - Trust in CUIs is multifaceted, encompassing cognitive and affective elements, attitudinal and behavioral components, and context-dependent manifestations.
    - Overtrust and undertrust in CUIs can lead to discontinued use, addiction, and potential negative consequences in critical domains such as finance and health.

3. **Workshop Objectives and Activities**
    - The workshop focuses on refining the conceptual boundaries of trust in CUIs, scrutinizing design and evaluation techniques, and exploring the interconnections of trust with other values.
    - It aims to facilitate interdisciplinary discussions, nurture collaborations, and consider future contributions to CUI research.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the significance of trust and reliance in CUIs, highlighting the complexity and potential consequences of these factors. However, the workshop objectives and activities outlined in the article seem ambitious for a one-day event. The range and depth of topics to be covered within the workshop may lead to insufficient exploration of each area. Additionally, the lack of specific research methodologies or frameworks for addressing the trust-related issues in CUIs could be a limitation. Furthermore, while the interdisciplinary approach is emphasized, the potential biases or limitations arising from the organizers' diverse expertise are not discussed. Overall, the article effectively emphasizes the importance of trust in CUIs and provides a comprehensive overview of the workshop's scope and objectives but may benefit from more focused and pragmatic aims.
