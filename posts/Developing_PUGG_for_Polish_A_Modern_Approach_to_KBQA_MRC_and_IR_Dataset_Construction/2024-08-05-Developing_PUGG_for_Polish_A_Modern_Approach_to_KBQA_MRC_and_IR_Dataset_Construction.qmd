### Summary:

- The paper introduces a modern, semi-automated approach for creating datasets for tasks such as KBQA, MRC, and IR, tailored explicitly for low-resource environments.
- The authors executed this pipeline and introduced the PUGG dataset, the first Polish KBQA dataset, and novel datasets for MRC and IR.
- The paper provides a comprehensive implementation, insightful findings, detailed statistics, and evaluation of baseline models.

### Major Findings:

1. The proposed pipeline generates natural and factoid questions in a semi-automated manner, significantly reducing the workload of human annotators.
2. The pipeline results in the creation of KBQA, MRC, and IR datasets while drastically reducing the labor of human annotators.
3. The paper introduces the PUGG dataset, which encompasses three tasks — KBQA, MRC, and IR. This dataset features natural factoid questions in Polish and stands out as the first Polish KBQA resource.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with existing KBQA datasets, which could help to understand the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.
- The paper does not discuss the potential biases in the generated datasets, which could be introduced by the LLMs and pre-existing datasets used in the pipeline.
- The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the performance of the baseline models on the PUGG dataset, which could help to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.
- The paper does not discuss the potential applications of the proposed approach in other low-resource languages, which could help to understand the generalizability of the proposed approach.
