### Summary:
- The paper explores the use of Personal Textual Knowledge Base (PTKB) for personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) and its impact on query reformulation.
- The authors investigate different approaches to obtain PTKB relevance judgment, including annotated by humans, LLM, and automatic labeling based on retrieval results.
- The study addresses three research questions: the best practice for PTKB selection, the best practice to incorporate PTKB into query reformulation, and the extent to which existing large language models (LLMs) can consider personalized aspects while reformulating queries.
- The experimental results show that PTKB might not always improve retrieval performance, but LLM can help generate a more appropriate personalized query when high-quality guidance is provided.

### Major Findings:
1. Human-annotated sentences may not necessarily provide useful information for improving retrieval results.
2. Automatic annotation of PTKB based on its impact on retrieval results is a better approach than human annotations.
3. LLM is a powerful tool to connect PTKB selection and query reformulation, especially when a few high-quality examples are provided.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The paper provides a valuable exploration of the use of PTKB for personalized CIR and its impact on query reformulation.
- The study highlights the potential discrepancy in human relevance judgment annotation of PTKB sentences with respect to retrieval effectiveness.
- The authors propose alternative approaches to leverage PTKB, such as automatic annotation and LLM-based query reformulation, which demonstrate promising results.
- However, the study does not address the issue of selective personalization for CIR, which should be investigated in future research.
- Additionally, the paper does not explore the potential of PTKB from a more sophisticated user modeling perspective, which could provide further insights into personalized CIR.
