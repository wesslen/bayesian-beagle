### Summary:

The paper introduces a novel technique called Video Watermarking to protect videos from unauthorized annotations by video-based Large Language Models (LLMs). The method imperceptibly embeds watermarks into key video frames using multi-modal flow-based losses, preserving the viewing experience while preventing misuse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Video Watermarking significantly reduces the comprehensibility of videos with various video-based LLMs, showcasing both stealth and robustness.

### Major Findings:

1. Video Watermarking is a pioneering method that safeguards video content integrity in the era of advanced multi-modal AI.
2. The strategic deployment of Video Watermarking substantially diminishes the likelihood of unauthorized access and misinterpretation of video content and description by video-based LLMs.
3. By integrating watermarks into a minimal portion of video frames (less than 20%), Video Watermarking effectively thwarts unauthorized access and ensures that video data remains protected from arbitrary exploitation.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a compelling solution to the growing concern of data protection in the context of video-based LLMs. However, it does not address the potential limitations or unintended consequences of using such watermarking techniques. For instance, the paper does not discuss the possibility of adversarial attacks on the watermarking system itself or the potential for watermarks to be detected and removed by malicious actors. Additionally, the paper does not explore the potential impact of watermarking on the performance of video-based LLMs or the potential for false positives in identifying unauthorized annotations. Further research is needed to address these concerns and ensure the robustness and reliability of the proposed Video Watermarking technique.
