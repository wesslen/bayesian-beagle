### **Summary:**
- The article discusses the use of large language models (LLMs) for perioperative care and focuses on the right dose for pretrained models.
- The study involves data cleaning and pre-processing, data extraction, model development, and evaluation of model safety.
- The authors leverage publicly available pre-trained clinical LLMs, including ClinicalBERT, BioClinicalBERT, and BioGPT, for their study.

### **Major Findings:**
1. **Data Cleaning and Pre-processing:**
   - Censored textual information that could be traced back to the patient in the BJH dataset.
   - Removed non-periodic punctuation and upper-cased all alphabets.
   - Removed 5,129 patients with no clinical notes associated with their records from the sample.

2. **Data Extraction:**
   - Determined AKI, delirium, pneumonia, DVT, and PE using specific criteria and screening methods.
   - Excluded patients without delirium screenings from the analysis of that complication.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Description of BERT's architecture and its bi-directional nature.
   - Utilization of publicly available pre-trained clinical LLMs, including ClinicalBERT, BioClinicalBERT, and BioGPT.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The article lacks a detailed discussion of the limitations of using LLMs for perioperative care.
- The study does not address potential biases in the data extraction process.
- The article could benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation of the safety of the models used.
- The authors should consider discussing the ethical implications of using LLMs in perioperative care.
