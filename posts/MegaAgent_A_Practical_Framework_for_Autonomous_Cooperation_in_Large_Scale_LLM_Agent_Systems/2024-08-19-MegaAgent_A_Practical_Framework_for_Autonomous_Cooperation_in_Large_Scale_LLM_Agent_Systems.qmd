### Summary:

The paper introduces MegaAgent, a practical framework designed for autonomous cooperation in large-scale LLM Agent systems. MegaAgent addresses the limitations of current LLM-MA systems by enabling dynamic task splitting, systematic planning, and monitoring of agent activities, and managing concurrent operations. The framework is designed with a hierarchical structure and employs system-level parallelism to enhance performance and boost communication. The effectiveness of MegaAgent is demonstrated through Gobang game development and national policy simulation, outperforming popular LLM-MA systems and showcasing its high autonomy and potential to rapidly scale up to 590 agents while ensuring effective cooperation.

### Major Findings:

1. MegaAgent is a practical framework designed for autonomous cooperation in large-scale LLM-MA systems, enabling dynamic task splitting and parallel communication among LLM agents.
2. The effectiveness of MegaAgent is validated through experiments in Gobang game development and national policy simulation, demonstrating its autonomy and scalability.
3. MegaAgent stands out for its high autonomy, multi-file support, parallelism, and scalability compared to current popular LLM-MA systems.

### Analysis and Critique:

While MegaAgent presents a promising solution for large-scale LLM-MA systems, there are potential limitations and areas for improvement. One concern is the reliance on a hierarchical structure, which may not be suitable for all types of tasks or environments. Additionally, the framework's performance may be affected by the inherent instability of LLM agent outputs, necessitating the development of more robust control mechanisms. Furthermore, the scalability of MegaAgent may be limited by the computational resources required to manage a large number of agents, which could impact its applicability in resource-constrained scenarios. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges and exploring alternative approaches to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of large-scale LLM-MA systems.
