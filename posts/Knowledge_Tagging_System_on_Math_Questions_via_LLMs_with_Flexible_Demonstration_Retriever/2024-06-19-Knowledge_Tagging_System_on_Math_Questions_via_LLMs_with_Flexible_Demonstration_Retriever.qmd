### Summary:

The paper presents a novel knowledge-tagging framework, KnowTS, which leverages the advanced mathematical and logical inference capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable knowledge tagging with only knowledge definition text. KnowTS has the potential to be swiftly applied with a few annotation samples, setting it apart from all previous training-based algorithms. To further boost the performance of KnowTS with demonstration samples, a reinforcement learning (RL) based demonstration retriever, Flexible Sequential Demonstration Retriever (FlexSDR), is proposed. FlexSDR aims to help LLMs exploit their potential from the demonstration samples while keeping only the necessary demonstrations as input for each input query. The paper validates the effectiveness of each component in KnowTS through experiments on an expert-annotated knowledge concept question dataset collected from a public K-12 education platform.
