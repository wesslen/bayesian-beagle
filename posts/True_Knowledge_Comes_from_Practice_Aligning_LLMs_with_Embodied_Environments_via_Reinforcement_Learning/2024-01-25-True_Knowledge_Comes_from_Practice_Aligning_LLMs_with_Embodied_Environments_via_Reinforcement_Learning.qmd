**Summary:**

The article discusses the misalignment issues of large language models (LLMs) in solving simple decision-making tasks and proposes "TWOSOME," a framework that deploys LLMs as decision-making agents aligned with embodied environments via reinforcement learning (RL). The TWOSOME framework utilizes LLMs to form behavior policies and employs normalization methods to enhance policy stability. Additionally, it designs a parameter-efficient training architecture and observes superior generalization ability to unseen tasks.

### Major Findings:
1. The TWOSOME framework exhibits significantly better sample efficiency and performance compared to conventional RL methods in classical decision-making and simulated household environments.
2. TWOSOME shows superior generalization ability to unseen tasks due to the open-vocabulary feature of LLMs.
3. There is no significant loss of the LLMsâ€™ original ability during online PPO finetuning.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article presents a novel approach, TWOSOME, to align LLMs with embodied environments, showcasing improved sample efficiency, performance, and generalization. However, while the TWOSOME framework shows promise, the study lacks an in-depth comparison with other state-of-the-art baselines and alternative methods. Additionally, it would benefit from a more comprehensive discussion on the limitations and potential biases of the proposed framework. Further research should focus on addressing the computational cost and potential methodological challenges associated with the proposed approach.
