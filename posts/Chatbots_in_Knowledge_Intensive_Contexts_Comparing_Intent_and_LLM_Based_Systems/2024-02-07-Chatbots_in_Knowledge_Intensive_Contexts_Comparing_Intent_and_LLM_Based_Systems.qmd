### **Summary:**
- Cognitive assistants (CA) are chatbots that provide context-aware support to human workers in knowledge-intensive tasks.
- Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have led to large language models (LLM) that enable CAs to converse in a more flexible, human-like manner.
- A user study comparing an LLM-based CA to an intent-based system revealed that LLM-based CAs exhibited better user experience, task completion rate, usability, and perceived performance than intent-based systems.

### Major Findings:
1. LLM-based CAs exhibited better user experience, task completion rate, usability, and perceived performance than intent-based systems.
2. The information contained in the foundation models can be extended by providing context material, a process called retrieval augmented generation (RAG).
3. LLM-based systems could help alleviate some of the constraints of intent-based systems as they are quick to deploy and have superior NLP capabilities.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study suggests that LLM-based CAs could help workers retrieve information and share knowledge more efficiently than intent-based systems.
- However, it is important to consider the ethical, productivity, and safety implications of using LLM-based systems, especially due to the potential for hallucinated information.
- The study's limitations include the use of industrial design master students instead of factory workers and the challenge of comparing the two NLP systems fairly.
- Future work could explore the impact of LLM-based systems on work tasks and associated risks, as well as the incorporation of suggested inputs and multimodality in knowledge-intensive contexts.
