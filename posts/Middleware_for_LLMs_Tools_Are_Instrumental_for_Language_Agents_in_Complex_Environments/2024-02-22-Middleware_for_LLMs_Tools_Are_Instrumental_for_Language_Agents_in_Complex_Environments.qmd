### Summary:
The article investigates the potential of using tools to augment large language models (LLMs) in handling complex real-world environments. The authors design customized tools to aid in proactive exploration within massive environments, serving as a middleware layer shielding the LLM from environmental complexity. The study demonstrates the significant potential of augmenting language agents with tools in representative complex environments, such as knowledge bases (KBs) and databases. Equipped with these tools, GPT-4 achieves significant performance improvements in tasks requiring access to database content and KB tasks. The authors conclude that the findings illuminate the path for advancing language agents in complex real-world applications.

### Major Findings:
1. The study demonstrates the significant potential of augmenting language agents with tools in complex environments, with GPT-4 achieving 2.8 times the performance of the best baseline in tasks requiring access to database content and 2.2 times in KB tasks.
2. The authors develop tailored tools for databases and KBs, including navigational and functional tools, to support extensive operations and diverse needs within complex environments.
3. Equipping LLMs with customized tools leads to significant improvement over previous standards, almost doubling or tripling the performance under multiple metrics.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study focuses on databases and KBs, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other types of complex environments.
- The authors acknowledge the need for a more principled strategy for tool design to further enhance performance, indicating potential limitations in the current tool design.
- The study demonstrates the potential of tool augmentation for language agents but does not address potential ethical or societal implications of using LLMs in complex real-world applications.
