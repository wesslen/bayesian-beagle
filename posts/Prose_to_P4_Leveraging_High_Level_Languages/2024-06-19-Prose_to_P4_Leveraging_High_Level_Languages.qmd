### Summary:

* The introduction of programmable dataplanes and associated languages, such as P4 and NPL, has enabled a wide range of networking applications.
* Software development in these languages is difficult due to limited hardware resources, the need for customization, and the complexity of adding or removing support for protocols.
* High-level dataplane programming languages (HLDPLs) have been designed to offer programmers powerful abstractions that reduce the time, effort, and domain-knowledge required for developing networking applications.
* Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation, the authors propose to raise the level of abstraction even higher, employing LLMs to translate prose into high-level networking code.
* The authors analyze the problem, focusing on the motivation and opportunities, as well as the challenges involved and sketch out a roadmap for the development of a system that can generate high-level dataplane code from natural language instructions.
* The authors present some promising preliminary results on generating Lucid code from natural language.

### Major Findings:

1. High-level dataplane programming languages (HLDPLs) have been designed to offer programmers powerful abstractions that reduce the time, effort, and domain-knowledge required for developing networking applications.
2. The authors propose to raise the level of abstraction even higher, employing LLMs to translate prose into high-level networking code.
3. The authors present some promising preliminary results on generating Lucid code from natural language.

### Analysis and Critique:

* The authors' proposal to use LLMs to translate prose into high-level networking code is an interesting and innovative approach to addressing the challenges of software development in P4 and NPL.
* The authors' focus on HLDPLs as a target for code generation is a logical choice, given their ability to offer powerful abstractions and reduce the time, effort, and domain-knowledge required for developing networking applications.
* The authors' preliminary results on generating Lucid code from natural language are promising, but more research is needed to fully evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach.
* One potential limitation of this approach is the lack of a large dataset of programs written in HLDPLs, which could make it difficult
