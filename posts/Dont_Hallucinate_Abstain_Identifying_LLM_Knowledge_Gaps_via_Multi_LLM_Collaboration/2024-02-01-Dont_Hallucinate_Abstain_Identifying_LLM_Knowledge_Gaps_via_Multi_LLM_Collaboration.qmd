### Summary:
The article discusses the identification of knowledge gaps in large language models (LLMs) and the development of mechanisms for LLMs to abstain from generating low-confidence outputs. The authors propose two novel approaches, Cooperate and Compete, based on multi-LLM collaboration, to identify knowledge gaps in LLMs. Extensive experiments with three LLMs on four QA tasks demonstrate that both cooperative and competitive approaches achieve up to 19.3% improvements on abstain accuracy against the strongest baseline. The proposed mechanisms could help identify failure cases in retrieval augmentation and pinpoint knowledge gaps in multi-hop reasoning.

### Major Findings:
1. The proposed Cooperate and Compete approaches achieve up to 19.3% improvements on abstain accuracy against the strongest baseline.
2. Both cooperative and competitive approaches to unveiling LLM knowledge gaps demonstrate significant improvements in identifying failure cases in retrieval augmentation and pinpointing knowledge gaps in multi-hop reasoning.
3. The proposed collaboration-based approaches work well with all four tasks, especially with the strongest ChatGPT language model.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The proposed collaboration-based approaches require prompting multiple LLMs for feedback and could have more computational overhead.
- The article focuses on the conceptual "abstain" functionality and develops robust approaches to identify knowledge gaps in large language models.
- The proposed collaboration-based approaches have shown great potential in improving LLM abstention in direct QA, retrieval-augmented QA, and multi-hop reasoning scenarios.
- The article acknowledges potential fairness implications of LLM abstain decisions, especially in critical domains such as hate speech and misinformation.

Overall, the article provides valuable insights into the identification of knowledge gaps in LLMs and proposes innovative approaches to improve LLM abstention. However, the article could benefit from further exploration of the intersections of LLM social biases and their abstention abilities, especially in critical domains. Additionally, the computational overhead of the proposed collaboration-based approaches should be carefully considered.
