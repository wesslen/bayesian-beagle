**Summary:**

This study provides a comprehensive review of smart grid security, focusing on system architectures, attack methodologies, defense strategies, and future research opportunities. The review includes an in-depth analysis of various attack vectors, with a focus on new attack surfaces introduced by advanced components in smart grids. The study also examines coordinated attacks that incorporate multiple attack strategies and exploit vulnerabilities across various smart grid components to increase their adverse impact. The review then investigates innovative detection and mitigation strategies, including game theory, graph theory, blockchain, and machine learning, discussing their advancements in counteracting evolving threats and associated research challenges. The study also covers a thorough examination of widely used machine learning-based mitigation strategies, analyzing their applications and research challenges across supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, ensemble, and reinforcement learning. Finally, the review outlines future research directions and explores new techniques and concerns, such as large language models (LLMs) and the emerging threat of adversarial machine learning in the future of smart grid security.

**Major Findings:**

1. Smart grids are vulnerable to various security threats due to their increased connectivity and complexity, including cyber, cyber-physical, and coordinated attacks.
2. Coordinated attacks that exploit multiple vulnerabilities across various smart grid components pose a significant threat to smart grid security.
3. Innovative detection and mitigation strategies, such as game theory, graph theory, blockchain, and machine learning, have shown promise in counteracting evolving threats to smart grid security.
4. Machine learning-based mitigation strategies, including supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, ensemble, and reinforcement learning, have been widely used to detect and mitigate smart grid security threats.
5. The use of LLMs and the emerging threat of adversarial machine learning pose new challenges and opportunities for smart grid security.

**Analysis and Critique:**

This study provides a comprehensive review of smart grid security, highlighting the various attack vectors and innovative detection and mitigation strategies. However, the study does not provide a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of these strategies in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the study does not discuss the potential impact of emerging technologies, such as quantum computing and edge computing, on smart grid security. Furthermore, the study does not provide a detailed
