### **Summary:**
- Large language models (LLMs) are being explored as systems that can mimic human intelligence, with potential applications in replacing human participants in experiments.
- The paper introduces a framework for large language models personification, including a strategy for constructing virtual characters' life stories, a Multi-Agent Cognitive Mechanism for simulating human cognitive processes, and a psychology-guided evaluation method.
- Experimental results demonstrate that the constructed simulacra can produce personified responses that align with their target characters.

### **Major Findings:**
1. LLMs can simulate human cognitive processes, assisting researchers in exploring human interactions without real human participants.
2. The Multi-Agent Cognitive Mechanism enhances the quality of simulacra by simulating human brain's information processing and memory systems.
3. The psychology-guided evaluation method assesses the quality of human simulations from both self-reporting and external observation perspectives.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The paper's approach has limitations, including data insufficiency, evaluation challenges, and inherited model limitations.
- The evaluation framework for measuring LLMs' humanizing capabilities is complex and subjective, requiring further development.
- LLMs may face challenges in accurately defining the knowledge boundaries of the target persona and producing harmful viewpoints or toxic content during interaction.

Overall, the paper provides a preliminary exploration of the potential of Large Language Model Personification, offering a fresh perspective for understanding complex human behaviors and expanding the potential applications of artificial intelligence in social science and psychological research. However, there are several limitations and challenges that need to be addressed in future research.
