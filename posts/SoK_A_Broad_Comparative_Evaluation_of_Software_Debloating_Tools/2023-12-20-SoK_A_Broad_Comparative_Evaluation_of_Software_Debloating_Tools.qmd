### Summary:

The academic article provides a comprehensive overview of software debloating techniques, metrics, and tools. It surveys over 60 scholarly articles on debloating, establishes a debloating taxonomy, and discusses the challenges associated with debloating metrics. The article also presents the design and evaluation metrics of CHISEL, examines the impact of debloating on low complexity benchmarks, and introduces a differential testing tool called DIFFER. Additionally, it covers the use of DIFFER for post-debloating validation and discusses various automated software debloating techniques.

### Major Findings:
1. The lack of standardized metrics for measuring the success of debloating tools.
2. The impact of debloating on program performance and security posture.
3. The need for new approaches to support more complex software packages and programming language features.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the challenges and limitations associated with software debloating. It highlights the lack of established metrics, the impact of debloating on program performance and security, and the need for new approaches to address soundness issues in debloating tools. However, the study also emphasizes the potential of automated debloating techniques for optimizing software and improving its overall efficiency. Further research and development are needed to address the performance and security concerns associated with debloating.
