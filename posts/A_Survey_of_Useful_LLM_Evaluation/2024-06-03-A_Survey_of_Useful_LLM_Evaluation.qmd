### Summary:

The study discusses the importance of evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their exceptional performance on a wide range of complex tasks. The authors propose a two-stage framework to examine whether LLMs are sufficiently useful tools. The first stage focuses on the core ability evaluation, which includes reasoning, societal impact, and domain knowledge. The second stage discusses the LLMs agent applications, such as planning, application scenarios, and benchmarks. The authors also provide an analysis of the current performance levels of LLMs in these domains and examine the challenges currently confronting the evaluation methods for LLMs, as well as the directions for future development.

### Major Findings:

1. The study proposes a two-stage framework to evaluate the usability of LLMs, from core ability to agent.
2. The core ability evaluation includes reasoning, societal impact, and domain knowledge, with a focus on the applications of LLMs pertaining to the specific capability and the evaluation methods.
3. The LLMs agent applications include planning, application scenarios, and benchmarks, with a focus on the applications of LLMs, evaluation methods, and datasets.
4. The authors provide an analysis of the current performance levels of LLMs in these domains and examine the challenges currently confronting the evaluation methods for LLMs.
5. The authors propose several directions for the advancement of LLMs evaluation methods aimed at making future evaluations of LLMs more flexible, automated, and capable of identifying the root causes of issues.

### Analysis and Critique:

The study provides a comprehensive overview of the evaluation methods for LLMs and their applications. The proposed two-stage framework is a useful tool for evaluating the usability of LLMs. However, the study does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations and biases of LLMs, which is an important aspect of evaluating their performance. Additionally, the study does not discuss the potential ethical implications of using LLMs in various domains, which is a critical consideration for their deployment in real-world applications. Furthermore, the study does not provide a detailed analysis of the challenges and limitations of the proposed evaluation methods, which is important for improving their accuracy and reliability. Overall, the study provides a valuable contribution to the field of LLMs evaluation, but further research is needed to address the limitations and biases of LLMs and the challenges and limitations of the proposed
