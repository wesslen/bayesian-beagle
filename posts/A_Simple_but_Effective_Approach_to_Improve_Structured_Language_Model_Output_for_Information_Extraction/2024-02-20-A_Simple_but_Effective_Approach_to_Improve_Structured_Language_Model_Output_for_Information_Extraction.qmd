### Summary:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in generating unstructured natural language but struggle with producing text in specific structured formats.
- The paper introduces a method, G&O, to enhance LLMs' structured text generation capabilities by breaking the generation into a two-step pipeline.
- Tested on zero-shot named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE), G&O significantly improves LLM performance with minimal additional efforts.

### Major Findings:
1. G&O effectively separates the generation of content from the structuring process, reducing the pressure of completing two orthogonal tasks simultaneously.
2. G&O-NER is superior to the One-Step approach, showing a significant increase in performance across various datasets.
3. G&O-RE enhances LLMs' performance on relation extraction tasks, registering an average F1 score improvement.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The paper provides a comprehensive and effective approach to improve LLMs' structured text generation capabilities.
- The study's limitations include the evaluation on a select number of datasets and tasks, as well as the exclusive use of Markdown tables for structuring the final output.
- The potential for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to align with the prompting format and the investigation of alternative structured formats are areas for future research.
