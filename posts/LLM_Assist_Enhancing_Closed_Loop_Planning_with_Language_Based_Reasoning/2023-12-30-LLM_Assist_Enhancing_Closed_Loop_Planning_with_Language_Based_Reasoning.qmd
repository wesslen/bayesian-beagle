### Major Takeaways
1. **Challenges in Planning for Autonomous Driving**: The paper addresses the challenges in planning for self-driving vehicles, highlighting the limitations of both learning-based and rule-based planners in handling complex driving scenarios.
2. **Integration of Large Language Models (LLMs)**: The study delves into the integration of LLMs, such as GPT4 and Llama2, to supplement existing planning algorithms, aiming to leverage the common-sense reasoning capabilities of LLMs for autonomous driving.
3. **State-of-the-Art Performance**: The proposed hybrid planner, LLM-Assist, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuPlan benchmark, outperforming existing pure learning- and rule-based methods across various metrics.

### Introduction
- **Significance of Planning in Autonomous Driving**: Planning algorithms for self-driving vehicles are crucial but face challenges in handling unconstrained driving environments.
- **Lack of Impact of Learning-based Planners**: While deep learning has impacted perception and prediction, it has not significantly impacted closed-loop planning, as evidenced by the recent nuPlan benchmark competition.
- **Limitations of Current Planners**: Learning-based planners suffer from overfitting, while rule-based planners struggle with scalability to handle all driving scenarios.

### Method
- **Novel Hybrid Planning Approach**: The paper introduces LLM-Assist, a hybrid planning approach that leverages a rule-based planner for common scenarios and an LLM-based planner for challenging, high-uncertainty scenarios.
- **Base Planner**: The study utilizes a state-of-the-art rule-based planner, PDM-Closed, which generates trajectory proposals and evaluates them using an internal simulator.
- **LLM-Assist Variants**: The LLM-Assist approach includes two variants: one where the LLM directly returns a safe future trajectory and another where the LLM provides parameters for the rule-based planner.

### Results
- **Performance**: LLM-Assist achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing dangerous driving events and outperforming the base planner across various metrics.
- **Ablation Studies**: The study explores the impact of various ablations, including the number of LLM queries, LLM control over emergency brake, and LLM architecture and timing.

### Critique
The paper effectively demonstrates the potential of LLMs in enhancing autonomous driving planning. However, it relies on a text-only model and does not directly address speed constraints and LLMs' tendencies to produce hallucinated outputs. Additionally, limitations regarding information richness, context, and processing speed should be considered.

Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into leveraging LLMs for autonomous driving planning, but future research should focus on addressing the identified limitations and improving the grounding, scalability, and speed of LLMs in this context.
