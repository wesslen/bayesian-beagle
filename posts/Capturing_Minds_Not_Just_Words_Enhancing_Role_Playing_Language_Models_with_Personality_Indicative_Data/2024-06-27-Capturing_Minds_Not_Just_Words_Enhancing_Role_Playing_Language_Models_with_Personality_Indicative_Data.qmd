### Summary:

This paper proposes a method to enhance role-playing language models (RPLMs) by incorporating personality-indicative data. The authors construct a dataset, RolePersonality, based on questions from 14 psychological scales, including both single-turn and multi-turn dialogues. The dataset is used to fine-tune RPLMs, and the results show improved performance in both personality-related and general role-playing evaluations.

### Major Findings:

1. The paper introduces a novel approach to developing RPLMs using personality-indicative data, enabling them to better capture the minds of characters.
2. The authors construct RolePersonality, a comprehensive dataset based on questions from 14 psychological scales, encompassing both single-turn and multi-turn dialogues.
3. Experimental results demonstrate that RPLMs fine-tuned with RolePersonality achieve refined performance in both personality-related and general RPA evaluations, validating the effectiveness of RolePersonality.

### Analysis and Critique:

* The paper presents a promising approach to enhancing RPLMs by incorporating personality-indicative data. However, the reliance on LLM-generated datasets may introduce biases or inaccuracies, potentially affecting the quality and authenticity of the dataset.
* The lack of compliance mechanisms in interview data can result in inconsistencies, undermining authenticity. The absence of human evaluation means subtle nuances in character portrayal may be missed by automated metrics.
* The evaluation of the model's performance primarily relies on automated metrics and LLM-based assessments, with the absence of human evaluation, subtleties and nuances in character portrayal might not be fully captured or assessed.
* The paper acknowledges the limitations and risks associated with the proposed approach, including the perpetuation of inherent biases and inaccuracies, the lack of compliance mechanisms, and the absence of human evaluation. Addressing these limitations in future work could further enhance the robustness and reliability of the developed RPLMs.
