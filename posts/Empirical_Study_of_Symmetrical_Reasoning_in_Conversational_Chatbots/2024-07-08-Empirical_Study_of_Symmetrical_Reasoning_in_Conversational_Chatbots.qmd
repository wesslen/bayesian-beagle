### Summary:

This study explores the capability of conversational chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) to understand and characterize predicate symmetry, a cognitive linguistic function traditionally believed to be an inherent human trait. Using in-context learning (ICL), a paradigm shift enabling chatbots to learn new tasks from prompts without re-training, the authors assess the symmetrical reasoning of five chatbots: ChatGPT 4, Huggingface chat AI, Microsoftâ€™s Copilot AI, LLaMA through Perplexity, and Gemini Advanced. The Symmetry Inference Sentence (SIS) dataset by Tanchip et al. (2020) is used to compare chatbot responses against human evaluations. The results reveal varied performance among chatbots, with some approaching human-like reasoning capabilities. Gemini, for example, reaches a correlation of 0.85 with human scores, while providing a sounding justification for each symmetry evaluation. This study underscores the potential and limitations of LLMs in mirroring complex cognitive processes as symmetrical reasoning.

### Major Findings:

1. Conversational chatbots powered by LLMs can understand and characterize predicate symmetry, a cognitive linguistic function traditionally believed to be an inherent human trait.
2. In-context learning (ICL) enables chatbots to learn new tasks from prompts without re-training, allowing them to approach human-like reasoning capabilities.
3. The Symmetry Inference Sentence (SIS) dataset by Tanchip et al. (2020) can be used to compare chatbot responses against human evaluations.
4. Gemini, a conversational chatbot, reaches a correlation of 0.85 with human scores, while providing a sounding justification for each symmetry evaluation.

### Analysis and Critique:

* The study highlights the potential of LLMs in mirroring complex cognitive processes as symmetrical reasoning, but also underscores their limitations.
* The use of ICL in chatbots allows them to approach human-like reasoning capabilities, but the performance among chatbots varies.
* The SIS dataset by Tanchip et al. (2020) is a useful tool for comparing chatbot responses against human
