### Summary:

This paper investigates the effects of model merging on the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors demonstrate that existing model merging techniques fail to explore the inherent trade-off between alignment and domain accuracy. They propose a safety-aware merging pipeline that achieves greater alignment of the merged model without sacrificing its accuracy. The authors present extensive experiments and ablations on the components of their pipeline, demonstrating its robustness in several conditions.

### Major Findings:

1. Existing model merging techniques fail to explore the inherent trade-off between alignment and domain accuracy.
2. The proposed safety-aware merging pipeline achieves greater alignment of the merged model without sacrificing its accuracy.
3. The authors present extensive experiments and ablations on the components of their pipeline, demonstrating its robustness in several conditions.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of LLM alignment by highlighting the importance of considering safety during the merging process. The proposed safety-aware merging pipeline is a promising approach to address the issue of misaligned models resulting from naive merging. However, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations or biases of the proposed method, nor does it provide a comparison with other existing methods for addressing the alignment problem. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential implications of the proposed method for real-world applications, such as the deployment of LLMs in safety-critical systems. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of the proposed method in different contexts and to compare it with other existing approaches.
