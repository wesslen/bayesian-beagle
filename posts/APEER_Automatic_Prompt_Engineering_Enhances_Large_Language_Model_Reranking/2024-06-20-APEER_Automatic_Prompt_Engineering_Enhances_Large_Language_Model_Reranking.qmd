### Summary:

The paper introduces a novel automatic prompt engineering algorithm called \ours, which aims to reduce human effort in designing prompts for zero-shot LLM reranking and unlock the potential of prompt optimization. \ours iteratively generates refined prompts based on feedback optimization of current prompts and preference optimization using positive and negative prompt demonstrations. The algorithm is evaluated using GPT4, GPT3.5, LLaMA3, and Qwen2 models, along with the TREC and BEIR benchmarks, demonstrating consistent performance improvements. The paper also highlights the transferability of prompts generated by \ours across diverse datasets and architectures.

### Major Findings:

1. \ours demonstrates significant performance improvements in zero-shot LLM reranking, outperforming existing state-of-the-art manual prompts.
2. The prompts generated by \ours exhibit better transferability across diverse tasks and LLMs.
3. The paper introduces a novel automatic prompt engineering algorithm that iteratively generates refined prompts through feedback and preference optimization.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper focuses on the listwise manual prompt in RankGPT for initialization, leaving other zero-shot relevance ranking methods less studied.
2. The impact of different first-stage retrievers, such as SPLADE++ EnsembleDistil, is not explored.
3. The paper acknowledges the potential risks and harms associated with LLMs, such as the generation of harmful, offensive, or biased content, and the need for further research to mitigate these challenges before deploying them in real-world applications.
