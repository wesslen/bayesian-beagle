title: "Divine LLaMAs: Bias, Stereotypes, Stigmatization, and Emotion Representation of Religion in Large Language Models"
id: "2407.06908v1"
description: "LLMs exhibit biases in emotion attribution along religious lines, with major religions in the US and Europe being more nuanced, while Eastern religions are stereotyped and Judaism and Islam are stigmatized. This is due to cultural bias and lack of NLP literature on religion."

### Summary:

This study explores how different religions are represented in Large Language Models (LLMs) through emotion attribution. The research reveals that major religions in the US and European countries are depicted with more complexity and depth, while Eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism are subject to stronger stereotypes. Judaism and Islam are frequently stigmatized, with higher refusal rates in responses. These findings are attributed to cultural bias in LLMs and the scarcity of NLP literature on religion. The study underscores the urgent need to address and rectify these biases.

### Major Findings:

1. Major religions prevalent in the US and European countries are depicted with more complexity and depth.
2. Eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism are subject to stronger stereotypes.
3. Judaism and Islam are frequently stigmatized, with higher refusal rates in responses.

### Analysis and Critique:

The study provides valuable insights into the representation of religions in LLMs, highlighting the need for more nuanced and fair representations. However, the research is limited to English and relies on a widely used emotion dataset of self-reports, which may limit the broader applicability of the results. The study also does not consider other religions, such as other Christian denominations or Zoroastrianism. The use of closed-source models like GPT-4o also limits the reproducibility of the results. Despite these limitations, the study lays the groundwork for future research in this area and emphasizes the importance of addressing cultural biases in LLMs.
