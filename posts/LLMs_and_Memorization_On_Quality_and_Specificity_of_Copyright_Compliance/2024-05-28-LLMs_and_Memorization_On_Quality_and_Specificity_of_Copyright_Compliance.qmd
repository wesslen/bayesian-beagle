**Summary:**
The paper "LLMs and Memorization: On Quality and Specificity of Copyright Compliance" investigates the issue of copyright infringement in large language models (LLMs) due to their ability to reproduce parts of their training data. The authors propose a systematic analysis to quantify the extent of potential copyright infringements in LLMs using European law as an example. They evaluate instruction-finetuned models in a realistic end-user scenario and use a threshold of 160 characters to identify potentially copyright-infringing textual reproductions. The paper also analyzes the specificity of countermeasures against copyright infringement by comparing model behavior on copyrighted and public domain data. The authors investigate what behaviors models show instead of producing protected text and provide a first legal assessment of these behaviors. The experiments show that current LLMs perform vastly differently in terms of the quality and specificity of their reproductions.
