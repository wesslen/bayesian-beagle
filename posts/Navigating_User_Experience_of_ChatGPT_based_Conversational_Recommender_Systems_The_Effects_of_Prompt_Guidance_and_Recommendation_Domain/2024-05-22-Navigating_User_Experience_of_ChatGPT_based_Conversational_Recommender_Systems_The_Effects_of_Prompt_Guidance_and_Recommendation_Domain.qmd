### Summary:

- The study investigates the impact of prompt guidance (PG) and recommendation domain (RD) on the overall user experience of a ChatGPT-based conversational recommender system (CRS).
- The research employs a mixed-method online empirical study with 100 participants, using a between-subjects design for PG (with vs. without) and a within-subjects design for RD (book recommendations vs. job recommendations).
- The findings reveal that PG can significantly enhance the system's explainability, adaptability, perceived ease of use, and transparency.
- Users are more likely to perceive a greater sense of novelty and demonstrate a higher propensity to engage with and try recommended items in the context of book recommendations compared to job recommendations.
- The influence of PG on certain user experience metrics and interactive behaviors appears to be modulated by the recommendation domain, as evidenced by the interaction effects between the two examined factors.

### Major Findings:

1. Prompt guidance (PG) substantially improves the system's explainability, adaptability, perceived ease of use, and transparency.
2. Users are more inclined to perceive a greater sense of novelty and demonstrate a higher propensity to engage with and try recommended items in the context of book recommendations compared to job recommendations.
3. The influence of PG on certain user experience metrics and interactive behaviors is modulated by the recommendation domain, as evidenced by the interaction effects between PG and RD.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The study's primary participants were native English speakers, which may not reflect the user experience of such a system from a non-native English speaker's perspective.
- The analysis of results mainly focuses on quantitative data, and future analysis should associate with qualitative data to have a deeper understanding of user behavior and perceptions of the system.
- Despite referencing relevant work and conducting extensive testing and optimization before the experiment, the prompt guidance may still not enable ChatGPT to perform at its best in recommendation tasks.
- The study substantiates the significant roles of PG and RD in shaping the user experience in ChatGPT-based CRS, emphasizing the importance of considering distinct user expectations and behaviors across various application domains and user contexts in a comprehensive design approach.
