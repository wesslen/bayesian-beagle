### **Summary:**
- Prompt engineering is essential for optimizing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their high sensitivity to the given prompt and the ambiguity of textual task instructions.
- Recent studies have shown that LLMs can automatically conduct prompt engineering by employing a meta-prompt that incorporates the outcomes of the last trials and proposes an improved prompt.
- However, the requirement for a high-quality benchmark to compare different prompts is difficult and expensive to acquire in many real-world use cases.

### Major Findings:
1. **Automatic Prompt Engineering:** Recent studies have demonstrated the capabilities of LLMs to automatically conduct prompt engineering by employing a meta-prompt that incorporates the outcomes of the last trials and proposes an improved prompt.
2. **Challenges in Benchmarking:** The requirement for a high-quality benchmark to compare different prompts is difficult and expensive to acquire in many real-world use cases.
3. **New Method for Automatic Prompt Engineering:** The article introduces a new method for automatic prompt engineering, using a calibration process that iteratively refines the prompt to the user intent.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article provides valuable insights into the challenges of prompt engineering and the potential of LLMs to automatically conduct prompt optimization.
- However, the reliance on high-quality benchmarks and the difficulty of acquiring them in real-world use cases is a significant limitation.
- The new method for automatic prompt engineering using a calibration process is promising, but further research is needed to validate its effectiveness in diverse real-world tasks and datasets.
- The article could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed method, as well as the need for further research and validation in real-world scenarios.
