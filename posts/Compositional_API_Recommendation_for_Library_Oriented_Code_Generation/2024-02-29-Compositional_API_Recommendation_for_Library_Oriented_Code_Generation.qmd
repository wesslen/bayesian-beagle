### Summary:

- Large language models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance in code generation, but the performance remains unsatisfactory in generating library-oriented code, especially for libraries not present in the training data of LLMs.
- A new approach, CAPIR (Compositional API Recommendation), is proposed to address the challenge of granularity inconsistency between developmental requirements and API recommendation.
- CAPIR employs an LLM-based Decomposer, an embedding-based Retriever, and an LLM-based Reranker to break down coarse-grained tasks, identify relevant APIs, and filter out redundant APIs.
- Two new benchmarks, RAPID and LOCG, are presented to facilitate the evaluation of API recommendation methods on coarse-grained requirements.
- Experimental results show that CAPIR outperforms existing baselines in API recommendation and library
