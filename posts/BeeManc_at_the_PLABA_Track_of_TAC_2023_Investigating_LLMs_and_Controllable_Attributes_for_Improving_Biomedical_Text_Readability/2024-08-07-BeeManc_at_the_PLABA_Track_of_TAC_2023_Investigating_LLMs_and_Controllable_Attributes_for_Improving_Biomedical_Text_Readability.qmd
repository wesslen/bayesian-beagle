### Summary:
- The study describes the models and methods used for participation in the PLABA2023 task on biomedical abstract simplification.
- The system outputs submitted include domain fine-tuned T5-like models, fine-tuned BART-Large model with controllable attributes, and ChatGPT-prompting.
- The official automatic evaluation using SARI scores ranked BeeManc 2nd among all teams, and the model Lay-SciFive ranked 3rd among all 13 evaluated systems.
- In the official human evaluation, the model BART-w-CTs ranked 2nd on Sentence-Simplicity and 3rd on Term-Simplicity among all 7 evaluated systems.
- In the second round of submissions, the team using ChatGPT-prompting ranked 2nd in several categories, including simplified term accuracy score and completeness score.

### Major Findings:
1. The fine-tuned T5 Small model obtained the highest scores in both BLEU and ROUGE metrics, including ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L.
2. The fine-tuned BART Large with CTs (BART-L-w-CTs) produced the highest SARI score at 46.54.
3. The fine-tuned T5 Base model achieved the highest BERTScore (72.62) with a slightly lower SARI score (44.10).
4. The fine-tuned SciFive Large achieved the highest SARI score (44.38) among T5-like models, though it was approximately 2 points lower than BART Large with CTs.
5. The GPT-like models did not beat T5-Base on both SARI and BERTScore and did not beat BART-w-CTs on SARI.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations or potential biases in the models used.
- The evaluation metrics used in the study, such as SARI, BERTScore, BLEU, and ROUGE, may not fully capture the quality of the simpl
