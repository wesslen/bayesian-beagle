### **Summary:**
- The article discusses the importance of minimizing social bias to strengthen societal bonds and promote shared understanding and better decision-making.
- The authors revisit the definition of bias and propose a framework that includes eight hypotheses about bias and a minimizing bias strategy for each assumption.
- The article also discusses the limitations of previous social bias work and proposes solutions to these challenges.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The bias that refers to an inclination or prejudice for or against one person or group is a major reason for societal division and injustice.
2. The authors propose a framework that includes eight hypotheses about bias and a minimizing bias strategy for each assumption.
3. The article discusses the limitations of previous social bias work and proposes solutions to these challenges.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The article provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of bias and proposes a framework to minimize bias in dynamic environments.
- The authors highlight the limitations of previous social bias work and propose solutions to these challenges.
- The proposed framework and hypotheses provide a valuable contribution to the field of bias research, but the realization of the framework is yet to be completed.
