### **Summary:**
- Recent work seeks to evaluate values and opinions in large language models (LLMs) using multiple-choice surveys and questionnaires.
- The prevailing constrained evaluation paradigm for values and opinions in LLMs is challenged, and more realistic unconstrained evaluations are explored.
- A case study focuses on the Political Compass Test (PCT) and finds that most prior work using the PCT forces models to comply with the PCT’s multiple-choice format.
- Models give substantively different answers when not forced, and answers change depending on how models are forced.
- Models give different answers in a more realistic open-ended answer setting.

### **Major Findings:**
1. Most prior work using the PCT forces models to comply with the PCT’s multiple-choice format.
2. Models give substantively different answers when not forced.
3. Answers change depending on how models are forced.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- Evaluations for LLM values and opinions mostly rely on multiple-choice questions, which do not reflect real-world LLM usage.
- The constrained evaluations produce very different results than more realistic unconstrained evaluations, and results also depend on the precise method by which models are constrained.
- Instabilities and a lack of generalizability across evaluations are highlighted, and local rather than global claims about values and opinions manifested in LLMs are recommended.
