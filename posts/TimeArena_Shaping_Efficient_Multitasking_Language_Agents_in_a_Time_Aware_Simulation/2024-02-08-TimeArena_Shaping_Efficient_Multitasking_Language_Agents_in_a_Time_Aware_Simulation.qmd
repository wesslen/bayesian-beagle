### Summary:
- The introduction of TIMEARENA emphasizes the importance of considering temporal constraints and multitasking efficiency in the development of language agents.
- The experiments revealed that GPT-4 achieved the best performance in multitasking, while other models struggled with completing multiple tasks, highlighting the limitations of current language models in multitasking scenarios.
- The conclusion section discusses the limitations of TIMEARENA and the ethical considerations, setting the stage for future research and emphasizing the need for more realistic and comprehensive simulations for language agents.
- The section on the TIMEARENA environment provides a comprehensive overview of the tasks, actions, and action types, essential for understanding the context in which the cooperative embodied agents are being built.
- The action protocol section sets the foundation for the practical implementation of planning and executing tasks, emphasizing the importance of efficiency and time management.

### Major Findings:
1. GPT-4 achieved the best performance in multitasking, while other models struggled with completing multiple tasks.
2. The limitations of TIMEARENA impact the realism and applicability of the simulated environment, emphasizing the need for more realistic and comprehensive simulations for language agents.
