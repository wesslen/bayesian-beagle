# Summary

## Major Findings
1. The paper presents the development of an AI tool called **KITSUNE** to support authors in formatting their work into the style of a CHI paper. It aims to provoke discussion about the **writing conventions** upheld by the CHI community and how these conventions shape the work produced.
2. The authors analyze the use of headings and writing conventions in ACM CHI papers from 1997 to 2019, addressing the changes over time and differences among different types of papers.
3. The paper raises questions about how the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) into academic writing fundamentally changes how conventions are upheld and how their presence may affect future writing.

## Abstract
The paper introduces an AI tool called KITSUNE meant to promote discussion on **writing conventions** in CHI papers and their impact on the work produced. It highlights the trend in the use of headings and writing conventions in CHI papers and their differences among various paper types. The authors also question how the introduction of LLMs into academic writing will fundamentally change writing conventions.

## Introduction
The section outlines the significance of the ACM CHI conference and the aim to investigate changes in the structure and content of CHI papers. It emphasizes the need to analyze the use of headings, adoption of writing conventions, and various text features in ACM CHI papers from 1997 to 2019.

## Related Work
The section reviews previous studies on writing conventions in ACM papers and highlights the analysis of headings and writing conventions. It emphasizes how writing conventions are used to improve the readability and organization of papers.

## Method
The authors collected data from the ACM CHI conference website and conducted survey studies to analyze the use of headings and writing conventions in CHI papers. They explain the data preprocessing methods and the experiments performed using Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment.

## [Human-Made] Introduction
The authors discuss the importance of genre conventions in the scientific community and the impact of these conventions on creative output and inclusivity, emphasizing how generative AI tools, like Large Language Models, are challenging established writing conventions.

## [Human-Made] KITSUNE: The Tool
The section describes the development process of the KITSUNE tool using PyTorch and Scikit-learn with open source models from HuggingFace. It details the data scraping and training process, the model used, and provides preliminary output generated by KITSUNE.

## [Human-Made] Author Commentary
The authors provide their individual commentaries on the impact of writing conventions at CHI, sharing perspectives on the reinforcement of conventions, the effects of writing conventions, and the need for discussions on conventions and styles within the community.

## [Human-Made] Conclusion
The conclusion refrains from providing next steps, key takeaways, or implications of the work and instead encourages readers to generate writing conventions to prompt their own investigations in this area.

# Critique
The paper lacks a cohesive structure, making it challenging to discern the main contributions and findings. Some sections are ambiguously written and provide convoluted explanations. Additionally, while the authors aim to challenge writing conventions, it's unclear how this work contributes to addressing the identified issues in a practical manner. The collaborative approach to writing the paper may cause confusion for readers, and the intentional deviation from conventions may hinder the clarity of the paper's message. A more coherent and focused approach to addressing writing conventions in CHI papers would enhance the impact of the paper.
