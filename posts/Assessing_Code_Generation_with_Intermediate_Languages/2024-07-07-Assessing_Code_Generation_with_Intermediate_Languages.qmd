description: "[TEXT] Abstract: This study examines the relationship between CEO narcissism and firm performance. Results indicate that narcissistic CEOs are associated with lower firm performance, suggesting that narcissism may have negative consequences for organizational outcomes.

[TL;DR] Narcissistic CEOs linked to poorer firm performance."

### Summary:
- The study presents additional experiment results for intermediate-ground-truth to target generation for different models.
- The experiment results show that Rust emerges as the best intermediate language on average across all models, with natural language coming in second.
- For all Llama, Stable, and DeepSeek models, Rust outperforms other intermediate languages, while for GPT models, natural language demonstrates the best performance.
- Go shows better performance as an intermediate language compared to other popular languages such as C++, Java, and Python, while Python yields the worst results.
- Code generation-based models, including CodeLlama families, Stable-3b, and Deepseek-1.3b, Rust is a better than natural languages.
- For general-purpose language models, such as GPT models and Mixtral 8x, natural language has better performance.
- The study also examines the number of improvements brought by different intermediate representations and finds that, for all the programming languages studied, natural language is the most effective intermediate representation.

### Major Findings:
1. Rust emerges as the best intermediate language on average across all models, with natural language coming in second.
2. For all Llama, Stable, and DeepSeek models, Rust outperforms other intermediate languages, while for GPT models, natural language demonstrates the best performance.
3. Go shows better performance as an intermediate language compared to other popular languages such as C++, Java, and Python, while Python yields the worst results.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study provides valuable insights into the performance of different intermediate languages for intermediate-ground-truth to target generation.
- The findings suggest that Rust and natural language are the most effective intermediate languages, while Python yields the worst results.
- However, the study does not provide a detailed explanation for why Rust and natural language perform better than other languages.
- The study also does not consider the impact of other factors, such as the complexity of the tasks or the size of the models, on the performance of different intermediate languages.
- Further research is needed to understand the underlying reasons for the performance differences between different intermediate languages and to explore the impact of other factors on their performance.
