# Summary:

The paper presents a novel concept of context structurization to enhance LLM's (Large Language Models) cognition capability. The authors propose transforming plain, unordered contextual sentences into well-ordered and hierarchically structurized elements. This approach allows LLMs to better grasp intricate and extended contexts through precise attention and information-seeking along the organized structures.

The paper's main contributions are:

1. The concept of structurization to enhance LLM's cognition capability without altering the models.
2. The feasibility of distilling the structurization ability from giant commercial LLMs into a responsive and affordable StruXGPT-7B model.
3. Empirical demonstration of consistent cognition enhancement for various LLMs across model architecture and size variation on diverse NLP tasks.

The authors conduct extensive evaluations on various representative NLP tasks, revealing structurization's consistent effectiveness across the base language model's architectural designs and capacity scales. They also demonstrate the feasibility of distilling the context structurization ability from giant commercial LLMs into a responsive and private StruXGPT-7B model.

# Major Findings:

1. The concept of context structurization significantly enhances LLM's cognition capability, allowing them to better understand and process complex contexts.
2. The structurization ability can be distilled from giant commercial LLMs into a smaller, more responsive, and affordable StruXGPT-7B model.
3. Structurization consistently improves the performance of various LLMs across different model architectures and size variations on diverse NLP tasks.

# Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents an innovative approach to enhancing LLM's cognition capability through context structurization. The authors provide a well-structured and coherent summary of their work, along with a clear explanation of their methodology and findings.

However, the paper does not discuss potential limitations or shortcomings of the proposed approach. For instance, the authors do not address the computational cost of implementing context structurization or the potential impact on the model's training time. Additionally, the paper does not explore the potential biases that may be introduced during the structurization process or the implications of these biases on
