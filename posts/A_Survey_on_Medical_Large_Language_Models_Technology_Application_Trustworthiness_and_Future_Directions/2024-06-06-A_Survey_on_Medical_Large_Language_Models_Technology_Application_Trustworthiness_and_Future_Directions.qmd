**Summary:**

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Medical Large Language Models (Med-LLMs), outlining their evolution from general to medical-specific domains and their transformative impact on healthcare. The study explores the fundamental history and technology of LLMs, delving into the progressive adaptation and refinements of general LLM models in the medical domain. It emphasizes advanced algorithms that boost the LLMsâ€™ performance in handling complicated medical environments, including clinical reasoning, knowledge graph, retrieval-augmented generation, human alignment, and multi-modal learning.

The survey also explores the extensive applications of Med-LLMs across domains such as clinical decision support, report generation, and medical education, illustrating their potential to streamline healthcare services and augment patient outcomes. Recognizing the imperative for responsible innovation, the study discusses the challenges of ensuring fairness, accountability, privacy, and robustness in Med-LLMs applications, where ethical considerations, rigorous evaluation methodologies, and the formulation of regulatory frameworks are pivotal to fostering trustworthiness in these systems.

**Major Findings:**

1. Med-LLMs have emerged as an innovative and powerful adjunct in the medical field, transforming traditional practices and heralding a new era of enhanced healthcare services.
2. The evolution of LLMs has dramatically reshaped the dilemma of weak expressivity and interactive capabilities in pre-trained language models (PLMs) by inducing innovative capabilities that better align with the rigorous requirements of the clinical environment.
3. Med-LLMs can bring a multitude of advantages to healthcare, including enhanced medical knowledge comprehension, improved diagnostic accuracy, personalized treatment recommendations, etc.
4. Existing explorations in the field of Med-LLMs have delivered various effective perspectives to promote the rapid development of medical AI societies, but the potential pathways of Med-LLMs are still under-explored.
5. Aligning the development of Med-LLMs with the complex needs in the clinical environment is vital for better patient care and advancing medical research.

**Analysis and Critique:**

This survey provides a comprehensive investigation of the potential strengths and limitations of Med-LLMs for professionals and researchers, ensuring a responsible landscape in the healthcare setting. However, it is important to note that the study primarily focuses on
