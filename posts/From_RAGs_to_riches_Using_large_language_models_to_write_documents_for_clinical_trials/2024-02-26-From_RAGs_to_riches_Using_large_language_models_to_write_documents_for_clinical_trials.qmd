### **Summary:**
- Clinical trials require numerous documents to be written, including protocols, consent forms, and clinical study reports.
- Large language models (LLMs) offer the potential to rapidly generate first versions of these documents, but there are concerns about the quality of their output.
- An evaluation of LLMs in generating parts of clinical trial protocols found that an off-the-shelf LLM delivers reasonable results, especially when assessing content relevance and the correct use of terminology. However, deficiencies remain in clinical thinking and logic, and appropriate use of references.

### **Major Findings:**
1. Off-the-shelf LLM delivers reasonable results, especially in content relevance and the correct use of terminology.
2. Deficiencies remain in clinical thinking and logic, and appropriate use of references.
3. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methodology substantially improves the writing quality of the LLM, especially in clinical thinking and logic.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- Off-the-shelf LLM scores relatively poorly in clinical thinking and logic, often not following the latest guidelines and containing errors.
- Current GPT-4 cannot natively source references, limiting its use in clinical trial-related writing.
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methodology substantially improves the writing quality of the LLM, making a material difference to the practical useability of LLMs in clinical trial-related writing.
