### **Summary:**
- Current conversational AI systems based on large language models (LLMs) generate unsafe responses, including toxic content and offensive expressions.
- Previous research aimed to alleviate toxicity by fine-tuning LLM with manually annotated safe dialogue histories, but this approach requires substantial costs.
- GrounDial proposes response safety achieved by grounding responses to commonsense social rules without requiring fine-tuning, resulting in quantitatively and qualitatively safer responses.

### Major Findings:
1. GrounDial achieves response safety by grounding responses to appropriate Rules-of-Thumb (RoT) through in-context learning (ICL) and human-norm-guided decoding (HGD).
2. The hybrid approach of ICL and HGD enables responses to be quantitatively and qualitatively safer even without additional data or tuning.
3. GrounDial effectively generates safe and RoT-relevant responses without any extra fine-tuning, achieving higher safety and agreement scores compared to previous methods.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The proposed GrounDial framework effectively addresses the limitations of previous approaches by grounding responses to RoT without requiring additional fine-tuning.
- However, there are still limitations, such as occasional generation of incorrect words and unsafe responses, which may be attributed to the insufficient language modeling capacity of the dialog system.
- Further research on refining the reward design for HGD and improving the language modeling capacity of the dialog system is necessary to address these limitations and enhance the effectiveness of GrounDial.
