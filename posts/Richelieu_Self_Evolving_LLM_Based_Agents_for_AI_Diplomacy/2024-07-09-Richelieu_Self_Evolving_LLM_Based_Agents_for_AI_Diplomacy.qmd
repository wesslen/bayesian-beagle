**Summary:**

The paper introduces Richelieu, a self-evolving LLM-based agent for AI diplomacy. The model enables hierarchical planning for multi-agent tasks and utilizes a memory module for reflective optimization. The model does not require human data and can evolve through self-play, ultimately outperforming existing models like Cicero in the Diplomacy game. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the modules established. Experiments using different LLMs validate the generalization of the framework to various LLMs.

**Major Findings:**

1. Richelieu, a self-evolving LLM-based agent, outperforms existing models like Cicero in the Diplomacy game without requiring human data.
2. The model enables hierarchical planning for multi-agent tasks and utilizes a memory module for reflective optimization.
3. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the modules established in the model.
4. Experiments using different LLMs validate the generalization of the framework to various LLMs.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper presents an innovative approach to AI diplomacy using a self-evolving LLM-based agent, Richelieu. The model's ability to outperform existing models without requiring human data is a significant achievement. The use of a memory module for reflective optimization is a novel approach to improving the model's performance. The ablation study provides evidence of the effectiveness of the modules established in the model. However, the paper does not discuss the limitations of the model or potential areas for improvement. Additionally, the generalization of the framework to various LLMs is validated through experiments, but the paper does not provide details on the specific LLMs used or the results of these experiments. Overall, the paper provides a promising approach to AI diplomacy, but further research is needed to address these limitations and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.
