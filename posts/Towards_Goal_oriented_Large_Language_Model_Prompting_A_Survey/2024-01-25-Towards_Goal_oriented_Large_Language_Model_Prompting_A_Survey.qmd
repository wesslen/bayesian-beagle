### Summary:

The article discusses the limitations of prompt engineering while assuming that large language models (LLMs) can think like humans and promotes a goal-oriented prompt formulation. It introduces a taxonomy categorizing goal-oriented prompting methods and demonstrates its broad applicability in different tasks. 

### Major Findings:
1. **Goal-oriented Prompt Formulation:** The paper highlights that a goal-oriented prompt formulation, guiding LLMs to mimic human logical thinking, significantly improves LLMs' performance in various tasks.
2. **Taxonomy of Methods:** The article introduces a comprehensive taxonomy categorizing goal-oriented prompting methods into five interconnected stages and demonstrates their applicability in different tasks such as reasoning, planning, question answering, code generation, dialogue, and recommendation.
3. **Future Directions:** The research proposes four promising future directions, including the synergy of stages in the framework, applications to other tasks, efficiency problems, and hierarchical decomposition, to further emphasize and promote goal-oriented prompt engineering.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article effectively highlights the limitations of prompt engineering and presents a compelling argument for a goal-oriented prompt formulation to optimize LLMs' performance. The comprehensive taxonomy provided enhances understanding and application of goal-oriented prompting methods. However, the research primarily focuses on accuracy, and there is a need to consider efficiency as a crucial factor. Additionally, the article should have discussed potential limitations or biases in the reviewed studies and addressed conflicting evidence to provide a more balanced perspective. Overall, the article makes a valuable contribution to promoting goal-oriented prompt engineering, but further research is needed to address efficiency and potential biases in the studies reviewed.
