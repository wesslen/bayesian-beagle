description: "[TEXT] Abstract: This paper explores the role of social media in shaping public opinion during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. We analyze a dataset of 171 million tweets and find that social media played a significant role in influencing voter attitudes and behaviors. Our results suggest that social media can be a powerful tool for political mobilization and persuasion.

[TL;DR] Social media influenced voters in the 2016 U.S. election."

### Summary:
- The preliminary ranking of WMT24 General MT systems is based on automatic metrics, with the official ranking being a human evaluation.
- The report aims to provide preliminary results to participants, not to interpret any findings.
- Two top-performing metrics, MetricX-23-XL and CometKiwi-DA-XL, are used for the automatic ranking.
- Three types of MT systems are distinguished: constrained, open, and closed systems.
- Due to a high number of submitted systems, only a subset of 10 to 15 systems per language pair will be evaluated by humans.
- The remaining systems will be ranked based on AutoRank.
- The evaluated data covers 11 language pairs with approximately 1k segments per language, with an average size of around 32k words per language pair.
- The domains cover news, social, speech, and literary.
- Limitations include potential biases in the evaluation due to the use of Comet or MetricX during training and the use of paragraph-level test sets instead of sentence-level scenarios.

### Major Findings:
1. The preliminary ranking of WMT24 General MT systems is based on automatic metrics, with the official ranking being a human evaluation.
2. Two top-performing metrics, MetricX-23-XL and CometKiwi-DA-XL, are used for the automatic ranking.
3. Three types of MT systems are distinguished: constrained, open, and closed systems.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The use of automatic metrics for the preliminary ranking may introduce biases and limitations, as acknowledged in the report.
- The report does not provide any interpretation of the findings, which may limit its usefulness for participants.
- The selection of systems for human evaluation may not be representative of all submitted systems, as only a subset will be evaluated.
- The use of paragraph-level test sets instead of sentence-level scenarios may not accurately reflect the performance of the evaluated systems.
- The report does not discuss any potential methodological issues or conflicting evidence.
- The report does not provide any recommendations for further research or clarification of any unanswered questions.
