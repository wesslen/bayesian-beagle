### **Summary:**
- Identifying political actors in public discourse is crucial for analyzing societal debates.
- Traditional NLP components and LLMs were compared for actor identification in German newspaper reports.
- The LLM performed worse than the traditional pipeline, struggling to generate the correct canonical form.
  
### **Major Findings:**
1. Actor identification is challenging due to the use of pronouns in discourse.
2. The LLM is good at identifying the right reference but struggles with generating the correct canonical form.
3. A hybrid model combining the LLM with a classifier substantially outperforms both initial models.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The traditional pipeline outperformed the LLM, indicating limitations in the LLM's ability to control generated output.
- The LLM's difficulty in selecting the correct canonical form suggests a need for further research in improving LLM performance.
- The hybrid model showed significant improvement, highlighting the potential for integrating LLM-generated output with traditional approaches.

The article provides valuable insights into the challenges of actor identification in discourse and the limitations of LLMs in this task. However, the study is limited to one LLM, one corpus, and one evaluation, indicating the need for further research and extrinsic evaluation of the actor identifier. Additionally, future directions could explore retrieval-augmented generation for improved LLM performance.
