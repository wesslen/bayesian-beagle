### Summary:
- The article discusses the potential risks of using third-party customized Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPTs, highlighting the vulnerability and potential risks of LLM customization.
- It presents three different types of backdoor instruction attacks on LLMs: word-level, syntax-level, and semantic-level, along with details of evaluation datasets used for testing the attacks.
- The findings of three instruction backdoor attack methods are presented, emphasizing the susceptibility of more powerful LLMs to instruction backdoor attacks.
- The performance of defenses against word-level, syntax-level, and semantic-level attacks on LLMs is evaluated, with observations on the partial effectiveness of the defenses.

### Major Findings:
1. The vulnerability and potential risks associated with LLM customization, especially in the context of applications integrated with such models.
2. The effectiveness of semantic-level attacks in achieving high attack success rates across different datasets and LLMs.
3. The partial effectiveness of defenses against different types of attacks on LLMs, highlighting the need for further research and development of more robust defense mechanisms.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article provides valuable insights into the potential vulnerabilities of LLM customization and the need for rigorous security measures in the development and integration of customized LLMs.
- The results of the experiments show the significance of trigger configuration and evaluation metrics in assessing the performance of backdoor instruction attacks on LLMs.
- The findings emphasize the need for defenses against instruction backdoor attacks, especially for more powerful LLMs, and highlight the challenges posed by the stealthiness of these attacks in practical implementation.
- The examples provided demonstrate the impact of backdoor instructions on the classification of sentiment, underscoring the importance of addressing such vulnerabilities to ensure the reliability and integrity of AI technologies like GPTs.
