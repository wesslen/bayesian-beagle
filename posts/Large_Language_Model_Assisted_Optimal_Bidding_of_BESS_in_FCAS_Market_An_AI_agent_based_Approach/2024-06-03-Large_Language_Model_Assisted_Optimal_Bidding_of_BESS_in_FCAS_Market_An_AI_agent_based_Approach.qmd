### Summary:

This paper focuses on the bidding optimization of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) in the Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) market. The authors propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to model the actual bidding process and address the limitations of existing methods. They also introduce a Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)-based DRL algorithm to enhance the risk resilience of bidding strategies. Furthermore, the authors present an LLMs-assisted AI-agent interactive decision-making framework to improve the strategy timeliness, reliability, and interpretability in uncertain new scenarios.

### Major Findings:

1. The proposed framework, which includes a CVaR-DRL algorithm and an LLMs-assisted AI-agent interactive decision-making framework, demonstrates higher bidding profitability compared to baseline methods.
2. The CVaR-DRL algorithm effectively mitigates profit loss caused by various uncertainties, such as uncertain market conditions and imperfect insight.
3. The LLMs-assisted AI-agent interactive decision-making framework improves the bidding performance of the DRL agent in new scenarios through LLMs-assisted AI-agent interactive collaboration.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel approach to optimizing BESS bidding strategies in the FCAS market. The proposed framework addresses the limitations of existing methods and demonstrates improved performance in terms of bidding profitability and risk resilience. However, the following points should be considered:

1. The proposed framework relies on the availability of accurate market information and historical data. The performance of the framework may be affected by the quality and completeness of the input data.
2. The paper does not discuss the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed framework. It is important to evaluate the framework's performance in large-scale and real-world scenarios.
3. The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in the literature. A more thorough comparison would help to better understand the advantages and limitations of the proposed framework.
4. The paper does not discuss the potential impact of regulatory changes or market dynamics on the performance of the proposed framework. It is important to consider the adaptability of the framework to changing market conditions.

In conclusion,
