**Summary:**

This study explores the social dynamics surrounding the use of large language models (LLMs) in an undergraduate programming course. The research is guided by the social shaping of technology theory and focuses on two research questions: (1) How do social perceptions influence the usage of LLMs in an undergraduate intermediate-level programming course? (2) How does LLM usage relate to programming self-efficacy and midterm scores among undergraduate students in an intermediate-level programming course?

The study employs a mixed-methods approach, including an anonymous student survey, student interviews, and a regression analysis of midterm performance data with students' self-reported use of LLMs on homework. The findings suggest that students' engagement with LLMs is significantly associated with their perceptions of their future careers and their peers' usage. Additionally, the use of LLMs has mixed impacts on students' self-efficacy and perceived learning outcomes, with a notable negative correlation between LLM usage and self-efficacy regardless of major and a negative correlation between LLM usage and performance on the first midterm.

**Major Findings:**

1. Students' engagement with LLMs is significantly influenced by their perception of future career norms and their perception of peer usage.
2. The use of LLMs has mixed impacts on students' self-efficacy and perceived learning outcomes.
3. There is a notable negative correlation between LLM usage and self-efficacy regardless of major and a negative correlation between LLM usage and performance on the first midterm.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The study provides valuable insights into the social dynamics surrounding the use of LLMs in undergraduate programming education. However, the research has some limitations, including the context of the study, potential selection bias, reliance on self-reported data, and the correlational nature of the regression analyses. Additionally, the study's focus on peer-reviewed literature may have led to the omission of relevant contributions from non-peer-reviewed sources. Despite these limitations, the research offers a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamic between technology and social factors, challenging the notion of technological determinism. As LLMs and other AI technologies continue to evolve, it is crucial to consider the social dynamics that shape their appropriation.
