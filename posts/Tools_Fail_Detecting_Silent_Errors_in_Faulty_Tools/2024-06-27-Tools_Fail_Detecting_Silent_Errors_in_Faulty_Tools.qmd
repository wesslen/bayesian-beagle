### Summary:

- The paper introduces a framework for tools that focuses on a model's ability to detect "silent" tool errors and plan accordingly, aligning with the increasing use of models as tools.
- The authors provide an initial approach to failure recovery with promising results in a controlled calculator setting and embodied agent planning.
- The paper categorizes sources of tool-related errors and recovery methods, focusing on the often overlooked case of "tool-based" failures.
- The authors investigate tool errors in two distinct settings: a controlled environment with an LLM solving arithmetic problems using a broken calculator and a more natural "broken" tool setting involving a multimodal instruction-following agent.
- The paper examines how much and what type of deviation is necessary to trigger the LLM's recognition of the tool error in each setting.

### Major Findings:

1. LLMs can detect incorrect tool outputs without explicit error signals, but they tend to overtrust tools, copying incorrect outputs rather than ignoring them.
2. In-context intervention strategies, such as a simple disclaimer, prediction confidence scores, and a checklist of criteria to look out for, can help LLMs notice and correct mistakes.
3. Smaller models are more sensitive to in-context information, while larger models have more consistent performance.
4. CoT prompting and in-context examples can help models recover performance, nearly to the best no-tool scores.
5. LLMs can identify incorrect outputs, even when they are not able to produce the correct answer, by detecting mistakes in the tool outputs.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The paper provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing tool-related errors in LLMs, focusing on the often overlooked case of "tool-based" failures.
- The authors' investigation of tool errors in two distinct settings offers valuable insights into the challenges and potential solutions for improving LLM performance in tool-use scenarios.
- The paper's findings on the effectiveness of in-context intervention strategies and the impact of model size on performance are particularly noteworthy.
- However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed approach, as well as a discussion of alternative methods for addressing tool-related errors in LLMs.
