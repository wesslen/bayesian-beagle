### Summary:

- The paper introduces a Socratic teaching-based large language model (SocraticLLM) for improving the capability of mathematics teaching via conversation.
- The authors collect and release a high-quality mathematical teaching dataset, SocraticMATH, which provides Socratic-style conversations of problems with extra knowledge.
- A knowledge-enhanced LLM is proposed as a strong baseline to generate reliable responses with review, guidance/heuristic, rectification, and summarization.
- Experimental results show the advantages of SocraticLLM compared to several strong generative models.

### Major Findings:

1. **Socratic Teaching-Based LLM (SocraticLLM):** The authors propose a Socratic teaching-based LLM to guide learners toward profound thinking with clarity and self-discovery via conversation.
2. **High-Quality Mathematical Teaching Dataset (SocraticMATH):** The authors collect and release a high-quality mathematical teaching dataset, SocraticMATH, which provides Socratic-style conversations of problems with extra knowledge.
3. **Knowledge-Enhanced LLM:** The authors propose a knowledge-enhanced LLM as a strong baseline to generate reliable responses with review, guidance/heuristic, rectification, and summarization.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The paper presents an innovative approach to improving the capability of mathematics teaching via conversation using a Socratic teaching-based LLM.
- The authors' contribution of a high-quality mathematical teaching dataset, SocraticMATH, is a valuable resource for further research in this area.
- The proposed knowledge-enhanced LLM is a promising approach to generating reliable responses with review, guidance/heuristic, rectification, and summarization.
- However, the paper does not discuss potential limitations or biases in the proposed approach, which could be a topic for future research.
- Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other existing methods for improving the capability of mathematics teaching, which could be beneficial for understanding the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach.
