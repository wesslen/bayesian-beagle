### Summary:

InternLM-XComposer-2.5 (IXC-2.5) is a versatile large-vision language model that supports long-contextual input and output. It excels in various text-image comprehension and composition applications, achieving GPT-4V level capabilities with merely 7B LLM backend. Trained with 24K interleaved image-text contexts, it can seamlessly extend to 96K long contexts via RoPE extrapolation. This long-context capability allows IXC-2.5 to excel in tasks requiring extensive input and output contexts. Compared to its previous 2.0 version, InternLM-XComposer-2.5 features three major upgrades in vision-language comprehension: (1) Ultra-High Resolution Understanding, (2) Fine-Grained Video Understanding, and (3) Multi-Turn Multi-Image Dialogue. In addition to comprehension, IXC-2.5 extends to two compelling applications using extra LoRA parameters for text-image composition: (1) Crafting Webpages and (2) Composing High-Quality Text-Image Articles. IXC-2.5 has been evaluated on 28 benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source state-of-the-art models on 16 benchmarks. It also surpasses or competes closely with GPT-4V and Gemini Pro on 16 key tasks.

### Major Findings:
1. Ultra-High Resolution Understanding: IXC-2.5 enhances the dynamic resolution solution proposed in IXC2-4KHD with a native 560 Ã— 560 ViT vision encoder, supporting high-resolution images with any aspect ratio.
2. Fine-Grained Video Understanding: IXC-2.5 treats videos as a ultra-high-resolution composite picture consisting of tens to hundreds of frames, allowing it to capture fine details through dense sampling and higher resolution for each frame.
3. Multi-Turn Multi-Image Dialogue: IXC-2.5 supports free-form multi-turn multi-image dialogue, allowing it to naturally interact with humans in multi-round conversations.
4. Crafting Webpages: IXC-2.5 can be readily
