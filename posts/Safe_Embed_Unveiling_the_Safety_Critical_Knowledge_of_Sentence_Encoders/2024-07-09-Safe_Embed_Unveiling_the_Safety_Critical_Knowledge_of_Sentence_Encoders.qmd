### Summary:

The paper investigates the potential of sentence encoders to distinguish safe from unsafe prompts and classify various unsafe prompts according to a safety taxonomy. The authors introduce new pairwise datasets and the Categorical Purity (CP) metric to measure this capability. The findings reveal both the effectiveness and limitations of existing sentence encoders, proposing directions to improve sentence encoders to operate as more robust safety detectors.

### Major Findings:

1. The paper demonstrates that sentence encoders can function as detectors that can distinguish between safe and unsafe prompts, and to what extent this knowledge is present.
2. The authors create new pairwise datasets, Safety-Challenging and Safety-Contrast, to evaluate the ability of sentence encoders to distinguish between safe and unsafe prompts.
3. The authors introduce a new metric, Categorical Purity, to assess how well sentence encoders recognize common characteristics of unsafe prompts, enabling the evaluation of their ability to categorize prompts based on safety implications.
4. The study reveals the strengths and weaknesses of existing sentence encoders in identifying safety implications, effectively handling stereotypes and privacy-related topics but struggling with the understanding of various contexts.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the potential of sentence encoders to distinguish safe from unsafe prompts and classify various unsafe prompts according to a safety taxonomy.
2. The authors introduce new pairwise datasets and the Categorical Purity (CP) metric, which are valuable contributions to the field.
3. The study reveals both the effectiveness and limitations of existing sentence encoders, providing directions for future research to improve sentence encoders as robust safety detectors.
4. However, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations of the proposed approach, such as the generalizability of the findings to other types of prompts or the scalability of the approach to larger datasets.
5. The paper also does not provide a detailed comparison of the proposed approach with existing methods for detecting unsafe prompts, which could have provided a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
6. The paper does not discuss the potential ethical implications of using sentence encoders as safety detectors, such as the risk of false positives or negatives and the
