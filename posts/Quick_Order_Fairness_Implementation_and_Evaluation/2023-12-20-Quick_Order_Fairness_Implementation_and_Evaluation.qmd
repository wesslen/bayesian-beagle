### Summary

**Title:** Quick Order Fairness: Implementation and Evaluation

**Authors:** [Anonymous]

This paper revisits the Quick Order-Fair Atomic Broadcast (QOF) protocol and describes a modular implementation using a generic consensus component. An empirical evaluation is performed to compare the performance of QOF to a consensus protocol without fairness. The paper also discusses the deployment of the QOF protocol into practical systems, offering two integration approaches. The authors evaluate the efficacy of the QOF protocol in terms of scalability, throughput, and latency. The benchmark results indicate that QOF reduces throughput by at most 5% and increases latency by about 50ms with four servers, reflecting the impact of the algorithm's increased complexity in an ideal, emulated network.

### Major Findings

1. **Decentralized Finance and Vulnerabilities:** The paper addresses the vulnerabilities in decentralized finance, notably front-running by malicious actors, and presents the QOF protocol as a solution to prevent such attacks.

2. **QOF Protocol Implementation:** The paper provides a modular implementation of the QOF protocol, including components such as Byzantine consistent broadcast, validated Byzantine consensus, and a graph module. This implementation is aimed at validating the theoretical base of the proposed solution.

3. **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper conducts an empirical evaluation of the QOF protocol, showcasing its performance in terms of scalability, throughput, and latency. It compares QOF to a consensus protocol without fairness and also discusses the impact of transaction payload size and network delay on the protocol's performance.

### Evaluation and Critique

**Strengths:**
- The paper provides a comprehensive description of the QOF protocol's implementation, including its components and integration into real-world systems.
- The empirical evaluation offers valuable insights into the performance of the QOF protocol, especially its scalability, throughput, and latency.
- The comparison with other protocols provides context and helps contextualize the performance of QOF in relation to existing solutions.

**Weaknesses:**
- The paper lacks transparency regarding the authors' identities, affiliations, and acknowledgments, which could affect its credibility.
- The paper's evaluation could benefit from a more diverse benchmark setup, including real-world network environments and various transaction types, to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the QOF protocol's performance.

Overall, while the paper makes significant contributions to the understanding and practical implementation of the QOF protocol, addressing the identified weaknesses could enhance its credibility and applicability in real-world scenarios.
