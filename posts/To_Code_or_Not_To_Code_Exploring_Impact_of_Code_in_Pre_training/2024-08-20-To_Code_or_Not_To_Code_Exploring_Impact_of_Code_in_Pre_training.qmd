# Summary:

- The study explores the impact of including code in the pre-training data mixture for LLMs, even when the models are not specifically designed for code-related tasks.
- The research aims to analyze the precise impact of code on non-code tasks, as previous work has only provided anecdotal evidence of its importance.
- The authors conduct extensive ablations and evaluate across a broad range of natural language reasoning tasks, world knowledge tasks, code benchmarks, and LLM-as-a-judge win-rates for models with sizes ranging from 470M to 2.8B parameters.
- The results show a consistent improvement in performance when code is included in the pre-training data, with up to a relative increase of 8.2% in natural language reasoning, 4.2% in world knowledge, 6.6% improvement in generative win-rates, and a 12x boost in code performance.
- The study suggests that investments in code quality and preserving code during pre-training have positive impacts on the model's performance.

# Major Findings:

1. Code is a critical building block for generalization far beyond coding tasks.
2. Improvements to code quality have an outsized impact on performance across all tasks.
3. The addition of code in pre-training results in a relative increase of 8.2% in natural language reasoning, 4.2% in world knowledge, 6.6% improvement in generative win-rates, and a 12x boost in code performance.

# Analysis and Critique:

- The study provides valuable insights into the impact of code on non-code tasks, which has been a relatively unexplored area.
- The authors conduct a comprehensive evaluation using a wide range of benchmarks, which strengthens the validity of their findings.
- However, the study does not discuss the potential limitations or biases in their methodology, which could be a topic for future research.
- Additionally, the study does not explore the impact of code on other types of tasks, such as those involving multimodal data or reinforcement learning.
- Future work could also investigate the impact of code on models with different architectures or training objectives.
