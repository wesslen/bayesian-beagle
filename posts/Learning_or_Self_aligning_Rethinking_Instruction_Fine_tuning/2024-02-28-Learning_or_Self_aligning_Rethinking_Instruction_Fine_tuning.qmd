### **Summary:**
- Instruction Fine-tuning (IFT) is a critical phase in building large language models (LLMs).
- Previous works mainly focus on the IFTâ€™s role in the transfer of behavioral norms and the learning of additional world knowledge.
- Surprisingly, attempts to learn additional world knowledge through IFT often struggle to yield positive impacts and can even lead to markedly negative effects.
- Maintaining internal knowledge consistency before and after IFT is a critical factor for achieving successful IFT.

### Major Findings:
1. IFT data consistent with model parameter knowledge leads to superior IFT outcomes.
2. Using IFT data that aligns with model parameter knowledge yet is erroneous yields better performance than employing those that are correct but incongruent with model parameter knowledge.
3. Ensuring that the model does not learn world knowledge conflicting with parameter knowledge during IFT enhances the effectiveness of IFT.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study focuses on the role of Instruction Fine-tuning (IFT) in large language models (LLMs) and its impact on the transfer of behavioral norms and additional world knowledge.
- The findings reveal that the core function of IFT is not to learn domain-specific world knowledge, but to facilitate self-aligning instruction with the already existing parameter knowledge of LLMs.
- The study provides guidance for future IFT data construction, model training, and model evaluation, shedding light on the future direction of data construction, model learning, and model evaluation for IFT.
- The limitations of the study include the focus on multiple-choice questions and the use of models with about 10B parameters, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Further research on larger models and free-style generation is recommended.
