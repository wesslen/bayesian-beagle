### Summary:

The paper introduces M2Lingual, a novel multilingual, multi-turn instruction finetuning dataset designed to better align large language models (LLMs) with a diverse set of languages and tasks. M2Lingual contains 182K instruction-following pairs, covering 70 languages, 17 NLP tasks, and general instruction-response pairs. The dataset is built using a task-specific taxonomy-guided evolve conditions to generate new instruction-response pairs from seed samples in each language. The proposed data enrichment taxonomy is generic and can be extended to any monolingual or multilingual data.

### Major Findings:

1. LLMs finetuned with M2Lingual substantially outperform the majority of existing multilingual instruction finetuning datasets.
2. LLMs trained with M2Lingual consistently achieve competitive results across a wide variety of evaluation benchmarks compared to existing multilingual instruction finetuning datasets.
3. LLMs finetuned with M2Lingual achieve strong performance on a translated multilingual, multi-turn evaluation benchmark as well as a wide variety of multilingual tasks.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of M2Lingual with other existing multilingual instruction finetuning datasets, which could help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed dataset.
2. The paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed dataset, such as the potential biases introduced during the data generation process or the lack of diversity in the seed samples.
3. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the impact of the proposed dataset on the performance of LLMs on low-resource languages.
4. The paper does not discuss the potential applications of the proposed dataset in real-world scenarios, such as its use in building multilingual chatbots or virtual assistants.
5. The paper does not provide a detailed discussion of the ethical considerations involved in the use of the proposed dataset, such as the potential for misuse or the need for informed consent from the individuals whose data is used in the dataset.
