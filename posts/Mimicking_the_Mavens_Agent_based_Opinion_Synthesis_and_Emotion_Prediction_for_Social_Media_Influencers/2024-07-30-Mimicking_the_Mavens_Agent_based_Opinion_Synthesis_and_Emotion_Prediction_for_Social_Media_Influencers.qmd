# Summary:

The paper introduces a novel computational framework to predict opinion leaders' perspectives and the emotive reactions of the populace, addressing the challenges posed by the unstructured, context-sensitive, and heterogeneous nature of online communication. The research introduces an innovative module that starts with the automatic 5W1H (Where, Who, When, What, Why, and How) questions formulation engine, tailored to emerging news stories and trending topics. The study builds a total of 60 anonymous opinion leader agents in six domains and realizes the views generation based on an enhanced large language model (LLM) coupled with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The efficacy of the automated 5W1H module is corroborated by an average GPT-4 score of 8.83/10, and the influencer agents exhibit a consistent performance, achieving an average GPT-4 rating of 6.85/10 across evaluative metrics. The methodology accurately foresees key influencers' perspectives and aligns emotional predictions with real-world sentiment trends in various domains.

# Major Findings:
