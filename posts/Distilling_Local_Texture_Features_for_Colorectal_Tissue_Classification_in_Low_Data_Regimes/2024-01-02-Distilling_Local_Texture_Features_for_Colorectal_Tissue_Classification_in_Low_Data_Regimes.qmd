### Major Takeaways
1. **Colorectal tissue classification** is a challenging task, particularly in low data regimes due to rare classes and limited availability of training samples.
2. The proposed **KD-CTCNet** employs knowledge distillation to capture local texture information from few tissue samples, achieving improved classification performance in low data regimes.
3. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that KD-CTCNet consistently outperforms standard pre-trained and fine-tuned CNN approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in low data settings.

### Introduction
- Colorectal cancer is a significant global health concern, and automatic classification of histopathology tissue images is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment.
- Existing works assume ample labeled training samples, but rare instances and expensive manual annotation make data availability limited.

### Method
- The paper proposes **KD-CTCNet**, a knowledge distillation-based approach that captures local texture information from limited tissue samples to improve CNN features for colorectal tissue classification in low data regimes.
- **Local-Global feature Enrichment** via Knowledge Distillation is the core framework, where a standard global branch and a local image branch are used to extract and compare feature representations.

### Experiments and Results
- The method is evaluated on two public datasets, Kather-2016 and Kather-2019, showcasing consistent improvement over existing approaches across low data settings.
- Qualitative analysis demonstrates KD-CTCNet's superiority in correctly classifying positive samples and reducing confusion between visually similar classes.

### Conclusion
- The proposed approach shows advanced performance in low data regimes by enriching standard CNN features with local texture information, demonstrating its potential for improving colorectal tissue classification.

### Critique
- The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods to solidify the proposed approach's superiority.
- The limitations of the proposed approach and potential challenges in real-world implementation could be further discussed for a comprehensive understanding.
