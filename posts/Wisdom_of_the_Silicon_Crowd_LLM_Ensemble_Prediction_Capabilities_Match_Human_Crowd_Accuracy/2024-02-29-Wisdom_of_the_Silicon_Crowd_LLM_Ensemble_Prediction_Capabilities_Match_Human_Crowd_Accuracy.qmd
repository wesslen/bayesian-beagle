### Summary

- Human forecasting accuracy relies on the 'wisdom of the crowd' effect, where predictions are improved by aggregating across a crowd of individual forecasters.
- Frontier LLMs underperform compared to a human crowd in a probabilistic forecasting context and fail to clear simple benchmarks.
- An LLM ensemble approach, consisting of a crowd of twelve LLMs, has been shown to outperform a simple no-information benchmark and is statistically equivalent to the human crowd in forecasting accuracy.
- LLM predictions benefit from exposure to the median human prediction as information, improving accuracy by up to 28%.
- The 'wisdom of the crowd' effect for LLMs, or the 'wisdom of the silicon crowd,' has been replicated, opening up potential applications throughout society.

### Major Findings

1. An LLM ensemble approach outperforms a simple no-information
