Overall, the results indicate that the offline version of the assistance policy in Algorithm 2 is more accurate and helpful than the online version. The offline policy is more effective in minimizing expected goal achievement cost and providing efficient assistance. However, the online policy is more accurate and helpful than the alternative assistance method, which involves randomizing over policies for each inferred goal.

In summary, the offline assistance policy is the most effective in providing accurate and helpful assistance, while the online policy is more accurate but less effective in providing efficient assistance. The alternative assistance method is less accurate and helpful compared to both the offline and online policies. These findings highlight the importance of minimizing expected cost under uncertainty and leveraging linguistic information for effective goal assistance.
