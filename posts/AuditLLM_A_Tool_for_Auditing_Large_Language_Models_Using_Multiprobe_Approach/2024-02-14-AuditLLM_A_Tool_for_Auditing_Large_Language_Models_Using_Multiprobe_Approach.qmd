### **Summary:**
- AuditLLM is a novel tool designed to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by auditing them using multiple probes generated from a single question to identify inconsistencies in the model's understanding or operation.
- The tool offers two key modes: Live mode for instant auditing of LLMs by analyzing responses to real-time queries, and Batch mode for comprehensive LLM auditing by processing multiple queries at once for in-depth analysis.
- AuditLLM is beneficial for both researchers and general users, as it enhances understanding of LLMs' capabilities in generating responses using a standardized auditing platform.

### **Major Findings:**
1. AuditLLM is a tool designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs by auditing them using multiple probes generated from a single question to identify inconsistencies in the model's understanding or operation.
2. The tool offers two key modes: Live mode for instant auditing of LLMs by analyzing responses to real-time queries, and Batch mode for comprehensive LLM auditing by processing multiple queries at once for in-depth analysis.
3. AuditLLM is beneficial for both researchers and general users, as it enhances understanding of LLMs' capabilities in generating responses using a standardized auditing platform.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- AuditLLM is designed exclusively for probing LLMs within the context of textual data and with inconsistencies in LLM's responses as the primary mechanism to identify potential problems.
- The tool may have limitations in terms of time-intensive loading of substantial size LLMs to generate responses.
- The authors acknowledge the need for further refinement of the tool, including adding support for more LLMs, plugging in other ways to create multiple probes, and providing more methods for assessing inconsistencies.
