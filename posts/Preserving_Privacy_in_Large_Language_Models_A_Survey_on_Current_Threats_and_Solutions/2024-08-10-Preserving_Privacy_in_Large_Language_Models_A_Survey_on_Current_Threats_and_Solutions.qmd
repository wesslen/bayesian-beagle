**Summary:**
The academic article "Preserving Privacy in Large Language Models: A Survey on Current Threats and Solutions" provides a comprehensive review of existing literature on privacy threats and solutions in Large Language Models (LLMs). The paper begins by discussing the significant advancements in artificial intelligence brought about by LLMs and the privacy concerns that arise from their reliance on massive internet-sourced datasets for training. The paper then delves into the concept of LLMs, their pre-training and fine-tuning processes, and the difference between white-box and black-box access. The paper also introduces various terminologies frequently used in the context of language models.

The paper then discusses the methods used to extract personal information from generative language models, such as memorization and association, and the use of masked language modeling tasks to reconstruct masked personal information. The paper also highlights the experiments conducted to reconstruct about 75% of
