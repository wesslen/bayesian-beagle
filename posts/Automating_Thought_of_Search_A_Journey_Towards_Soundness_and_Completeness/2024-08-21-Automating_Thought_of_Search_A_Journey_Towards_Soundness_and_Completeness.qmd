**Summary:**

The paper "Automating Thought of Search: A Journey Towards Soundness and Completeness" by Daniel Cao et al. introduces a method called AutoToS, which aims to automate the process of solving planning problems using large language models (LLMs). Unlike previous approaches, AutoToS defines the search space with code generated by the LLMs. The authors claim that their method achieves 100% accuracy with minimal feedback iterations, using LLMs of various sizes on all evaluated domains. The paper also discusses related works, background, and the proposed approach and methodology in detail.

**Major Findings:**

1. AutoToS, a new method for automating the process of solving planning problems using LLMs, achieves 100% accuracy with minimal feedback iterations.
2. AutoToS defines the search space with code generated by the LLMs, which is a novel
