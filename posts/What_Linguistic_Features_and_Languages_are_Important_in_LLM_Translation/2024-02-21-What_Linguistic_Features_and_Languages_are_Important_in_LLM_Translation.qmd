### **Summary:**
- LLMs, including Llama2, show strong machine translation capabilities across multiple languages.
- The 7B Llama2 model yields above 10 BLEU score for all languages it has seen, but not always for unseen languages.
- Syntactic similarity is not always the primary linguistic factor in determining translation quality.

### Major Findings:
1. Llama2 yields above 10 BLEU score for all languages it has seen, but not always for unseen languages.
2. Increasing model parameters is potentially more effective in improving translation over instruction tuning and few-shot learning.
3. Syntactic similarity is not always the most important linguistic feature nor are English features always the strongest correlating factors with machine translation scores.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study is limited by the lack of transparency of the data used for training LLMs, which makes it unclear which languages are included in the models.
- The research heavily depends on the language distances obtained from the URIEL typological database, which may have missing features, affecting the accuracy of the findings.
- The study is constrained by limited computational resources, preventing comprehensive coverage of all languages and Llama2 versions.
- The chat versions of Llama2 have been intentionally trained to prevent the generation of harmful or toxic content, which may affect the quality of translations.
- The study leaves the task of human evaluation and manual parsing of the outputs for future work.
