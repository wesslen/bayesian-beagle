### Summary

- LLM systems are inherently compositional, with individual LLMs serving as the core foundation with additional layers of objects such as plugins, sandbox, and so on.
- Existing studies on LLM security often focus on individual LLMs, but without examining the ecosystem through the lens of LLM systems with other objects.
- A new information-flow-based formulation is proposed to systematically analyze the security of LLM systems, focusing on the alignment of information flow within LLM and between LLM and other objects.
- The attack surface of the LLM system can be decomposed into three key components: (1) multi-layer security analysis, (2) analysis of the existence of constraints, and (3) analysis of the robustness of these constraints.
- An investigation of the state-of-art LLM system, OpenAI GPT4, exposes several security issues, not just within the LLM model itself but also in its integration with other components.

### Major Findings

1. **Multi-layer security analysis**: Security issues in LLM systems can be found not only within the LLM model itself but also in its integration with other components, such as the Frontend, Sandbox, and web plugins.
2. **Constraints analysis**: Examining the existence and robustness of constraints in LLM systems reveals vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers, such as bypassing safety constraints designed to prevent the LLM from outputting external image links.
3. **Real-world threats**: A practical, end-to-end attack is proposed, allowing an adversary to illicitly obtain a user's private chat history without manipulating the user's input or directly accessing OpenAI GPT4.

### Analysis and Critique

- The paper focuses on the security of OpenAI GPT4, and the findings may not directly apply to other LLM systems.
- The proposed multi-layer and multi-step approach to examine security concerns is not explicitly detailed, making it difficult to assess its effectiveness and limitations.
- The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion on potential mitigation strategies and countermeasures to address the identified vulnerabilities and threats.
- Further research is needed to explore the security implications of other LLM systems and the development of more generalizable methods for systematically analyzing security issues
