# Summary:

This paper presents a novel agentic workflow, PReP, for goal-directed city navigation without step-by-step language instructions or maps. PReP utilizes a fine-tuned LLaVA model for spatial perception, a memory module for synthesizing and reflecting perception results and retrieved memory, and a planning module for navigation route planning. The proposed method only requires training the visual perception part, making it a more data-efficient solution compared to RL methods. The agent can perform long-term navigation tasks in complex environments and achieves a success rate of about 60%. The paper also provides detailed experimental results, demonstrating the robustness and flexibility of the proposed method.

# Major Findings:

1. PReP significantly improves navigation ability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a success rate of about 60%.
2. The proposed method is more data-efficient than RL methods, as it only requires training the visual perception part.
3. The agent can perform long-term navigation tasks in complex environments, demonstrating robustness and flexibility.

# Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a well-structured and coherent summary of the proposed method, PReP, for goal-directed city navigation. The authors provide a detailed description of the method, including the fine-tuned LLaVA model for spatial perception, the memory module for synthesizing and reflecting perception results and retrieved memory, and the planning module for navigation route planning. The paper also includes a comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving navigation ability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

However, there are some potential limitations and shortcomings that should be considered. First, the proposed method relies on the availability of a fine-tuned LLaVA model for spatial perception, which may not be readily available for all applications. Second, the proposed method only considers goal-directed city navigation and may not be applicable to other types of navigation tasks. Finally, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the proposed method with other state-of-the-art methods for goal-directed city navigation, which could help to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method.

In conclusion,
