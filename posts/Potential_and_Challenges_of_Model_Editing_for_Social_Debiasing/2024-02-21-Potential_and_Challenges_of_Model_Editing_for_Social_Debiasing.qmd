### **Summary:**
- Large language models (LLMs) trained on vast corpora suffer from inevitable stereotype biases.
- Model editing methods have the potential to address debiasing by modifying LLMs in a post-hoc manner.
- The study benchmarks seven existing model editing algorithms on stereotypical debiasing and reveals both the potential and challenges of debias editing.

### Major Findings:
1. Existing model editing methods can effectively preserve knowledge and mitigate biases, but the generalization of debias effect from edited sentences to semantically equivalent sentences is limited.
2. Sequential editing highlights the robustness of SERAC, while internal editing methods degenerate with the number of edits.
3. Model editing algorithms achieve generalization towards unseen biases both within the same type and from different types.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study provides valuable insights into the potential and challenges of model editing for social debiasing.
- However, the study focuses on explicit biases present in sentences and does not consider implicit biases.
- The research is limited to foundational datasets and English-language datasets, and the ethical considerations of fair use of editing techniques need more attention.
