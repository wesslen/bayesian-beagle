### Summary:

The paper introduces RoleFact, a role-playing method that aims to mitigate hallucination in fictional character role-play by modulating the influence of parametric knowledge. The authors propose a dataset for Script Grounded Character Role-play (SGR) that includes more than 2,000 characters and 72,000 interviews, facilitating the study of temporal hallucination and hallucination for less popular characters. RoleFact improves factual precision by 18% for adversarial interviews, reduces temporal hallucination by 44% for time-sensitive interviews, and improves factual precision by 23% for less popular characters.

### Major Findings:

1. RoleFact, a role-playing method, improves factual precision by 18% for adversarial interviews and reduces temporal hallucination by 44% for time-sensitive interviews.
2. The proposed SGR dataset enables a systematic study of character hallucinations, including temporal hallucination and hallucination for less popular characters.
3. RoleFact improves factual precision by 23% for less popular characters, addressing a significant challenge in the field.

### Analysis and Critique:

* The paper presents a novel approach to mitigating hallucination in fictional character role-play, which is a significant challenge in the field.
* The proposed SGR dataset is a valuable resource for studying character hallucinations, as it includes more than 2,000 characters and 72,000 interviews.
* The paper's findings demonstrate the effectiveness of RoleFact in improving factual precision and reducing temporal hallucination.
* However, the paper does not address the potential limitations of RoleFact, such as its sensitivity to retrieval quality and the need for task-specific fine-tuning for dense retrieval.
* The paper also does not discuss the potential biases or limitations of the SGR dataset, which could impact the generalizability of the findings.
* Future research should explore the potential solutions to the limitations of RoleFact and the SGR dataset, such as filtering out irrelevant knowledge via self-reflection, task-specific fine-tuning for dense retrieval, and instruction-tuning for character role-play.
