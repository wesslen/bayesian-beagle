### Summary:
- Automated story generation has been a long-standing challenge in NLP, with suspense being relatively under-explored in AI-generated stories.
- The proposed method, grounded in cognitive psychology and narratology, uses large language models (LLMs) to generate suspenseful stories in a fully zero-shot manner without relying on supervised story corpora.
- Extensive human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in creating suspenseful stories.

### Major Findings:
1. Automated story generation has been a challenge in NLP, with suspense being relatively under-explored in AI-generated stories.
2. The proposed method, grounded in cognitive psychology and narratology, uses large language models (LLMs) to generate suspenseful stories in a fully zero-shot manner without relying on supervised story corpora.
3. Extensive human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in creating suspenseful stories.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The proposed method is effective in generating suspenseful stories, as demonstrated by extensive human evaluations.
- The method's reliance on large language models (LLMs) and its grounding in cognitive psychology and narratology contribute to its effectiveness.
- The study's limitations include its focus on English language stories and the need for further research to develop a fully functional non-English suspenseful story generation system.
