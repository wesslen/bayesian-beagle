### Summary:
The article presents an experimental validation of a sensor fusion-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). The framework incorporates two strategies: comparing predicted location shifts with inertial sensor-based location shifts and using a Random-Forest supervised machine learning model to detect and classify turns. The experiments demonstrate the framework's ability to detect various sophisticated GNSS spoofing attacks, showcasing its robustness and efficacy in safeguarding AVs against GNSS spoofing threats.

### Major Findings:
1. The detection framework successfully identifies location shifts with 100% accuracy in turn-by-turn attack scenarios.
2. The framework achieves high precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score in detecting wrong turn attacks, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-time detection.
3. The sensor fusion-based approach shows potential in enhancing AV navigation security and resilience in real-time scenarios.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the development and experimental validation of a sensor fusion-based GNSS spoofing attack detection framework for AVs. However, the study could benefit from a more extensive discussion of potential limitations and future research directions. Additionally, further exploration of the framework's performance in diverse environmental conditions and real-world scenarios would enhance the comprehensiveness of the findings. Overall, the article offers a promising approach to addressing GNSS spoofing threats in the context of autonomous mobility.
