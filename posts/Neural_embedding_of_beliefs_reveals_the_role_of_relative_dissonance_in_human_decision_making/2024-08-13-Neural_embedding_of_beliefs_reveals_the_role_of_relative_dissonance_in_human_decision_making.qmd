### Summary:

The study proposes a method for extracting nuanced relations between thousands of beliefs by leveraging large-scale user participation data from an online debate platform and mapping these beliefs to an embedding space using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). The belief embedding space effectively encapsulates the interconnectedness of diverse beliefs as well as polarization across various social issues. The positions within this belief space predict new beliefs of individuals, and the relative distance between one’s existing beliefs and new beliefs can serve as a quantitative estimate of cognitive dissonance, allowing for the prediction of new beliefs. The study highlights the potential of modern LLMs, combined with collective online records of human beliefs, to offer insights into the fundamental principles that govern human belief formation and decision-making processes.

### Major Findings:

1. The study introduces a reliable embedding space of general beliefs using LLMs integrated with online user activity data.
2. The resulting belief embedding space reveals structural characteristics and patterns, such as pronounced clustering and polarization in the belief space for certain social issues.
3. The belief space enables the prediction of an individual’s belief or positions on new social issues based on the individual’s prior beliefs.
4. The study uncovers underlying mechanisms for individual belief formation, such as the role of relative dissonance in human decision-making.
5. The study identifies factors relating to accurately predicting individual’s beliefs, such as the length of a user’s voting history, debate category, and the distances between a user and two beliefs under consideration.

### Analysis and Critique:

The study presents a novel approach to understanding human beliefs by leveraging LLMs and online user activity data. The proposed method offers a scalable and comprehensive solution for modeling human beliefs, which has been a challenge in previous research due to the reliance on surveys and small, topic-specific datasets. However, the study has some limitations that should be addressed in future research.

First, the reliance on a single online debate platform for data collection may limit the generalizability of the findings. Incorporating broader datasets from diverse platforms would help improve the understanding of the universal properties of belief systems and their cultural and social variations.

Second, the study does not investigate the temporal and dynamical properties of the belief space. Investigating how the shape of the
