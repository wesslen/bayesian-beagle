<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary"><strong>Summary:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Machine learning models often struggle with unseen out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, especially in real-world settings such as content moderation, spam detection, and healthcare.</li>
<li>Test-time augmentation (TTA) is a post-hoc technique that aggregates predictions across multiple augmentations of the test input to improve robustness.</li>
<li>LLM-TTA, which uses large language model (LLM)-generated augmentations, outperforms conventional augmentation functions across sentiment, toxicity, and news classification tasks for BERT and T5 models, improving BERT’s OOD robustness by an average of 4.30 percentage points without regressing average in-distribution (ID) performance.</li>

<li>ICR improves a BERT classifier’s absolute accuracy on OOD data by an average of 4.86% for sentiment, 6.85% for toxicity, and 1.18% for news topics, with minimal regression to ID performance.</li>
<li>TTA with conventional augmentation functions often hurts both ID and OOD performance.</li>

<p>The markdown summary of the academic article “BBox-Adapter: Lightweight Adapting for Black-Box Large Language Models” is as follows:</p>
<section id="summary" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adapting state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini for specific tasks is challenging due to the opacity in their parameters, embeddings, and output probabilities.</li>
<li>Existing fine-tuning adaptation methods are inapplicable to black-box LLMs, and adapting these models is only possible through their API services, raising concerns about transparency, privacy, and cost.</li>
<li>To address these challenges, the authors introduce BBox-Adapter, a novel lightweight adapter for black-box LLMs. BBox-Adapter distinguishes target and source domain data by treating target data as positive and source data as negative. It employs a ranking-based Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss to promote the likelihood of target domain data while penalizing that of the source domain. Furthermore, it features an online adaptation mechanism, which incorporates real-time positive data sampling from ground-truth, human, or AI feedback, coupled with negative data from previous adaptations. Extensive experiments demonstrate BBox-Adapter’s effectiveness and cost efficiency, improving model performance by up to x across diverse tasks and domains, while reducing training and inference costs by x and x, respectively.</li>

<ul>
<li>The study examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recruitment and the ethical concerns related to their lack of transparency.</li>
<li>The study uses a novel elicitation approach with prompts derived from common interview questions and prompts designed to elicit particular Big Five personality traits.</li>
<li>Results reveal that LLMs demonstrate high openness and low extraversion, with newer and larger LMs exhibiting a broader range of personality traits. Fine-tuned models exhibit minor modulations in their personality traits, contingent on the dataset.</li>
<li>The section discusses the OPT models, fine-tuned versions of GPT-2 and GPT-J-6B, and the interview prompt design for trait elicitation.</li>
<li>The study found that language models had high levels of openness, low extraversion, and moderate levels of the other Big Five traits. Unlike humans, these models are not influenced by trait-activation, likely due to the absence of social cues in computational models.</li>
<li>The study compares the performance of different language models, including GPT, Mistral, and Llama2, in responding to standard and trait-activating interview questions. The results show that smaller language models exhibit consistent responses across different types of questions, with a notable increase in emotional stability and agreeableness traits.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The article investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate human strategic behavior, specifically in the context of the ultimatum game, which is a classic economics experiment used to understand human social strategic behavior.</li>
<li>The study compares two LLM architectures: single- and multi-agent LLMs, and evaluates their abilities to simulate human-like actions in the ultimatum game, simulate two player personalities, and create robust strategies that are logically complete and consistent with personality.</li>
<li>The evaluation shows that the multi-agent LLM architecture is much more accurate than single LLMs in simulating human strategy creation and actions for personality pairs, with the multi-agent architecture being consistent with human behavior 88% of the time, compared to 50% for single LLMs.</li>

<li>Multi-agent LLMs outperformed single LLMs in modeling the actions of player personalities, achieving human-like gameplay for all four personality pairs at least 80% of the time.</li>
<li>Multi-agent architectures create robust strategies at a higher rate than SingleLLMs, with MultiAgent-4 creating complete and personality-consistent strategies for both players in 87.5% of simulations.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The paper introduces the VM-CTS method, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating verified programs in Dafny, Lean, and Coq. The method significantly improves the synthesis capabilities of open source models and can solve verified programming problems within 6 minutes.</li>
<li>Variations and extensions of the base method, such as the Diversity variant and In-Context Learning from Verifier Feedback, are presented to address potential weaknesses and improve the search process.</li>
<li>The “Discussion” section highlights the effectiveness of the technique for verified code generation using weak language models, while also acknowledging its limitations and potential for future work.</li>
</ul>
