### **Summary:**
- The article introduces Task-Oriented Automatic Dialogs (TOAD), a novel and scalable Task-Oriented Dialog (TOD) dataset along with its automatic generation pipeline.
- The TOAD dataset simulates realistic app context interaction and provides a variety of system response style options, including verbosity level and users' expression mirroring.
- The article presents a benchmark for future studies, establishing reference scores for two TOD Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, evaluating a variety of baseline models.

### Major Findings:
1. Task-Oriented Dialog (TOD) is a fundamental task of machine intelligence, involving goal-driven conversations between a human and a system to achieve specific tasks.
2. The TOAD dataset is the first highly automatically generated TOD dataset, providing insights into the dimensions of style that virtual assistants should consider.
3. The contributions of this work are three-fold: a new TOD dataset with multiple response styles and realistic app context interaction, an automatic TOD data generation pipeline for scalable, cost-effective expansion of data size and domains, and a benchmark for future studies.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article provides a comprehensive overview of the TOAD dataset and its automatic generation pipeline, addressing the challenges of creating high-quality annotated data for Task-Oriented Dialog (TOD).
- The study introduces a novel approach to modeling system response styles, including verbosity level and users' expression mirroring, which can enhance naturalness and adaptiveness for various usage scenarios.
- The article's findings are valuable for future research in the development of virtual assistants, but the potential limitations of the automatic generation pipeline and the need for further exploration of response styles are important areas for future investigation.
