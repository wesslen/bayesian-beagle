### Summary:
This academic article evaluates the correctness of responses for a set of 54 spatial tasks assigned to four prominent chatbots, i.e., ChatGPT-4, Bard, Claude-2, and Copilot. The chatbots performed well on spatial literacy, GIS theory, and interpretation of programming code and given functions, but revealed weaknesses in mapping, code generation, and code translation. ChatGPT-4 outperformed other chatbots across most task categories.

### Major Findings:
1. Chatbots performed well on spatial literacy, GIS theory, and interpretation of programming code and given functions.
2. Weaknesses were observed in mapping, code generation, and code translation.
3. ChatGPT-4 outperformed other chatbots across most task categories.

### Analysis and Critique:
The study provides a comprehensive comparison of the performance of different chatbots in handling spatial tasks. It highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each chatbot in various task categories. The results show that ChatGPT-4 performed the best overall, but all chatbots faced challenges in mapping and code generation tasks. The study also discusses the limitations of the research, such as the use of text-only inputs and the need for further evaluation of multimodal foundation models. Overall, the article provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of chatbots in handling spatial tasks. However, it would benefit from further exploration of the potential biases and ethical considerations associated with the use of large language models in spatial tasks.
