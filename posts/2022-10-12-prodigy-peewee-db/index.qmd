In a [previous post](posts/2022-10-11-prodigy-db-intro), I described some Prodigy database recipes that enable you to manipulate annotations saved into the default SQLite database.

However, that post abstractted


## Under the hood

Currently (v1.11.8), Prodigy uses `peewee` for its ORM. An ORM is a "object-relational mapping" library. An ORM provides tools to convert ("map") between objects in code and database tables ("relations").

With an ORM, you normally create a class that represents a table in a SQL database, each attribute of the class represents a column, with a name and a type.

For example, a class named `Animals` can represent a SQL table `animals`. Each instance object of that class represents a row in the database.

## datasette

To get started, let's first install `datasette`. 

```bash
pip3 install datasette
```



```bash
datasette ~/.prodigy/prodigy.db
```
