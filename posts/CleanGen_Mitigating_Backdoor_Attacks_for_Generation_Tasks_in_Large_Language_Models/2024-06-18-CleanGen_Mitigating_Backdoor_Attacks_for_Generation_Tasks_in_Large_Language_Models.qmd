### Summary:

The paper presents a novel inference-time defense, CleanGen, to mitigate backdoor attacks for generation tasks in large language models (LLMs). CleanGen is a lightweight and effective decoding strategy that is compatible with state-of-the-art LLMs. The insight behind CleanGen is that backdoored LLMs assign significantly higher probabilities to tokens representing the attacker-desired contents. These discrepancies in token probabilities enable CleanGen to identify suspicious tokens favored by the attacker and replace them with tokens generated by another LLM that is not compromised by the same attacker, thereby avoiding generation of attacker-desired content. The paper evaluates CleanGen against five state-of-the-art backdoor attacks and shows that CleanGen achieves lower attack success rates (ASR) compared to five baseline defenses for all five backdoor attacks. Moreover, LLMs deploying CleanGen maintain helpfulness in their responses when serving benign user queries with minimal added computational overhead.

### Major Findings:

1. CleanGen is a novel inference-time defense that effectively mitigates backdoor attacks for generation tasks in LLMs.
2. CleanGen is a lightweight and effective decoding strategy that is compatible with state-of-the-art LLMs.
3. CleanGen achieves lower attack success rates (ASR) compared to five baseline defenses for all five backdoor attacks.
4. LLMs deploying CleanGen maintain helpfulness in their responses when serving benign user queries with minimal added computational overhead.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a promising approach to mitigating backdoor attacks for generation tasks in LLMs. The use of a lightweight and effective decoding strategy that is compatible with state-of-the-art LLMs is a significant advantage. The evaluation of CleanGen against five state-of-the-art backdoor attacks and the comparison with five baseline defenses provide strong evidence of its effectiveness. However, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations or shortcomings of CleanGen, such as its applicability to other types of LLMs or its effectiveness against more sophisticated backdoor attacks. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead of CleanGen or its impact on the performance of LLMs. Further research is needed to address these
