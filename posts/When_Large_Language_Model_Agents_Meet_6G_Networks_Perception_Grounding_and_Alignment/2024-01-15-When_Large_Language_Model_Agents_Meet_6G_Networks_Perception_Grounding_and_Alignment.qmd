### **Summary:**
The article proposes a split learning system for large language model (LLM) agents in 6G networks, leveraging the collaboration between mobile devices and edge servers. It discusses the challenges of deploying LLM agents on mobile devices and the advantages of partitioning LLM agents into mobile and edge agents. The proposed system aims to provide democratic AI assistant services via the collaboration of mobile and edge LLM agents over end-edge-cloud computing.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The proposed split learning system for LLM agents in 6G networks aims to provide democratic AI assistant services via the collaboration of mobile and edge LLM agents over end-edge-cloud computing.
2. The article discusses several major issues in developing LLM agents in 6G networks, including integrated sensing and communication for multimodal perception, digital twins for grounding decisions, and task-oriented communications for the alignment of agents.
3. The article proposes a new optimization framework in the system, i.e., model caching for AI agents, which aims at maximizing the in-context learning capabilities of LLM agents while reducing the network costs of serving mobile and edge LLM agents.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
The article provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of deploying LLM agents in 6G networks. However, it lacks a detailed discussion of potential privacy concerns and security issues associated with the collaboration between mobile and edge LLM agents. Additionally, the article could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of the trade-offs and limitations of the proposed split learning system. Further research is needed to address these limitations and to evaluate the real-world performance of the proposed system.
