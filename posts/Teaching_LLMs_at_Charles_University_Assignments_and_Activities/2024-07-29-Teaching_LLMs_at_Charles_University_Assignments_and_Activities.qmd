### Summary:

- The paper presents teaching materials, particularly assignments and ideas for classroom activities, from a new course on large language models (LLMs) taught at Charles University.
- The course was composed of 13 sessions with various levels of interactivity, including lectures, directed discussions, quizzes, and practical work with LLMs.
- The assignments included experiments with LLM inference for weather report generation and machine translation.
- Classroom activities included class quizzes, focused research on downstream tasks and datasets, and an interactive "best paper" session aimed at reading and comprehension of research papers.

### Major Findings:

1. **Weather Report Generation:** Students worked in small teams to generate weather reports using LLMs. They experimented with various decoding parameters and models, including Mistral 7B, Mistral 7B Instruct, Phi-2, and Aya-101. The students reported difficulties in generating factually accurate outputs from the models.
2. **Machine Translation:** Students were given paragraphs of text in 21 languages and instructed to translate them using an LLM into English and then into a language of their choice. They experimented with prompt engineering and decoding parameters. The students could generally match the quality of commercial MT systems when translating into English from medium-resourced languages. However, translating into their languages appeared challenging.
3. **Classroom Activities:** The course included various classroom activities such as discussions, class quizzes, focused research on downstream tasks and datasets, and an interactive "best paper" session. These activities aimed to encourage student participation and critical thinking.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The paper provides a detailed overview of the course structure and activities, which can be beneficial for educators looking to develop similar courses.
- The use of practical assignments and interactive sessions can help students better understand the concepts and applications of LLMs.
- However, the paper does not provide a detailed evaluation of the course's effectiveness or student learning outcomes. It would be beneficial to have more information on how the course impacted students' understanding and application of LLMs.
- The paper also does not discuss potential challenges or limitations in implementing the course, such as the need for specialized hardware or the time required for students to complete the assignments.
- The course's focus
