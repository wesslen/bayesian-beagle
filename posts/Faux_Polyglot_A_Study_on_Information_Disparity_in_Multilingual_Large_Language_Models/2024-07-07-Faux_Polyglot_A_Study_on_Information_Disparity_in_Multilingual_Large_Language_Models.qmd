# Summary:

The study titled "Faux Polyglot: A Study on Information Disparity in Multilingual Large Language Models" explores the linguistic preference of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based information search setting. The research reveals that LLMs exhibit a systemic bias towards information in the same language as the query language in both information retrieval and answer generation. Furthermore, in scenarios where there is little information in the language of the query, LLMs prefer documents in high-resource languages, reinforcing dominant views. This bias exists for both factual and opinion-based queries, highlighting the linguistic divide within multilingual LLMs in information search systems.

# Major Findings:

1. LLMs display a systemic bias towards information in the same language as the query language in both information retrieval and answer generation.
2. In scenarios where there is little information in the language of the query, LLMs prefer documents in high-resource languages, reinforcing dominant views.
3. This bias exists for both factual and opinion-based queries, highlighting the linguistic divide within multilingual LLMs in information search systems.

# Analysis and Critique:

The study provides valuable insights into the linguistic preferences of LLMs in a RAG-based information search setting. However, the research is limited to a specific set of languages and does not explore the impact of cultural nuances, regional influences, and historical narratives on the linguistic divide. Additionally, the study does not address the potential methodological issues, conflicting evidence, or areas that require further research or clarification. Further studies are needed to fully understand the linguistic divide in LLMs and its implications for information parity.
