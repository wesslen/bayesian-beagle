Welcome to the Bayesian beagle blog! This project is a unique intersection of machine learning and scientific communication, providing a platform where readers can quickly get insights from the latest research papers hosted on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/). Utilizing state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), our system generates concise, comprehensible summaries of complex research articles, covering a wide array of disciplines.

**All content is LLM generated.** Assume skepticism and verify in the original paper as LLM models are imperfect and can struggle under certain circumstances.

Our blog is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and then published with [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).
