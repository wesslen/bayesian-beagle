### **Summary:**
- The study examines the impact of language-specific class imbalance on multilingual classification datasets.
- Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) on imbalanced datasets leads to worse performance, increased separation of languages in the latent space, and reliance on uninformative features.
- Modifying the traditional class weighing approach by calculating class weights separately for each language helps mitigate these detrimental effects.

### Major Findings:
1. Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are well-suited for automatic classification tasks due to their superior performance and easy fine-tuning on downstream tasks.
2. Imbalanced datasets lead to worse model performance and increased separation of languages in the latent space.
3. Modifying the traditional class weighing approach by calculating class weights separately for each language helps mitigate the detrimental effects of imbalance.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study provides valuable insights into the negative effects of language-specific class imbalance on multilingual fine-tuning.
- The use of SHAP values to analyze the model's reliance on uninformative features adds depth to the findings.
- The study's limitations include the artificial nature of the datasets and the sole use of SHAP values for explainability. Further research is needed to address these limitations and explore alternative methods for mitigating imbalance.
