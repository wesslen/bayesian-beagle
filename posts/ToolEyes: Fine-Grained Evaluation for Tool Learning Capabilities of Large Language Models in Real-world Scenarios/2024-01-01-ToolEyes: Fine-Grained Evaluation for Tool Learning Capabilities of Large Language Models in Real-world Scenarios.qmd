## Summary

### Major Findings
- **ToolEyes** is a system designed to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) capabilities to learn and utilize tools in real-world scenarios.
- The system focuses on evaluating LLMs in seven scenarios and across five essential capabilities for tool learning: format alignment, intent comprehension, behavior planning, tool selection, and answer organization.
- The study reveals that LLMs exhibit scenario-specific preferences in tool learning, and expanding the model size exacerbates the hindrance to tool learning.

### Evaluation System
- **Scenario Construction**: ToolEyes formulates seven real-world scenarios ranging from text generation to financial transactions, each with a collection of related tools.
- **Tool Library Building**: The system establishes a tool library of approximately 600 tools to serve as an interface for LLMs to interact with the environment.
- **Human-Driven Data Generation**: Professionals related to each scenario contribute to identifying actual requirements, resulting in 382 user queries after thorough manual validation.

### Model Selection and Results
- **Model Selection**: The study evaluates ten LLMs across three categories: open-source, tool-oriented, and closed-source, uncovering preferences and limitations in tool learning capabilities.
- **Results**: LLMs exhibit scenario-specific preferences, and the study uncovers limitations in LLMs' behavioral planning skills across various capabilities essential for effective tool learning.

## Critique

The paper provides valuable insights into the fine-grained evaluation of LLMs' tool learning capabilities. However, it relies heavily on the evaluation of LLMs without explicitly considering potential biases and limitations. Additionally, the study does not explore the potential impact of overfitting or bias in the dataset used for LLM evaluation. Moreover, the paper does not provide a clear discussion on the generalizability of the findings to broader applications or potential implications for industry and society. Further exploration of the robustness and applicability of the findings would enhance the paper's contribution to the field.
