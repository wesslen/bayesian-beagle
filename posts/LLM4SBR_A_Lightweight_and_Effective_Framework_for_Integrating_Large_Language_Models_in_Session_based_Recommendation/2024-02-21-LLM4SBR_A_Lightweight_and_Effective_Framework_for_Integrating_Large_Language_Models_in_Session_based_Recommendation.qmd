### **Summary:**
Traditional session-based recommendation (SBR) models often lack semantic information, resulting in a lack of interpretability in the recommended results. To address this, the authors propose the LLM Integration Framework for SBR (LLM4SBR), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance SBR models. The framework adopts a two-step strategy, transforming session data into a bimodal form of text and behavior. In the first step, LLMs are used for inference on session text data from different perspectives, and an intent localization module is designed to eliminate hallucinations and enhance semantics. In the second step, the SBR model is trained on behavior data, aligning and averaging two modal session representations from different perspectives. The results demonstrate that LLM4SBR significantly improves the performance of traditional SBR models and is highly lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for industrial deployment.

### **Major Findings:**
1. LLM4SBR significantly improves the performance of traditional SBR models.
2. The framework enhances model interpretability and the diversity of candidate selection.
3. LLM4SBR is highly lightweight and efficient, suitable for industrial deployment.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The study provides a comprehensive framework for integrating LLMs with SBR models, addressing the limitations of traditional SBR models.
- The framework's two-step strategy effectively enhances the performance and interpretability of SBR models.
- The study lacks a comparison with other existing LLM-enhanced SBR frameworks, which could provide a more comprehensive analysis of the proposed framework's effectiveness.
- The authors should consider conducting further research to explore the potential limitations and challenges of implementing the LLM4SBR framework in real-world industrial applications.
