### Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach to enhance Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) by integrating explicit reasoning capabilities and visual question generation. It outlines the development of a new dataset aimed at promoting chain-of-thought reasoning combined with question-asking mechanisms. The authors also introduce a three-stage training process focusing on image-text alignment, instruction tuning, and fine-tuning for chain-of-thought reasoning. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach in improving the robustness and interpretability of LMMs, enabling them to reason explicitly and proactively seek information when faced with ambiguous visual input.

### Major Findings:
1. The Introduction of Explicit Reasoning: The article underscores the significance of explicitly incorporating reasoning processes into Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) to enhance their interpretability and the accuracy of their inferences.
2. Importance of Question-Asking Mechanism: The integration of a question-generation step into the reasoning process is shown to facilitate the acquisition of necessary knowledge, highlighting the value of proactively seeking information during ambiguous reasoning situations.
3. Model Training and Dataset Creation: The article presents a novel dataset designed to promote chain-of-thought reasoning and question generation, and outlines a three-stage training process aimed at fine-tuning LMMs for explicit reasoning.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article effectively addresses the growing demand for LMMs with enhanced reasoning capabilities. However, it also highlights challenges in generating coherent and consistent long reasoning steps, leading to a decrease in evaluation scores for models using explicit reasoning processes. This suggests the need for further research to improve LMMs' ability to produce coherent and consistent long reasoning steps in line with the given tasks. Moreover, while the proposed approach shows promise, the study could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of the limitations and potential areas for further refinement. Additionally, the authors could consider exploring potential biases in the dataset creation and model training, providing a more critical evaluation of the proposed approach's limitations.
