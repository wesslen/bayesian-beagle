### Summary:
- The article investigates the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing their personalities using an external evaluation method.
- The authors fine-tuned a Llama2-7B model as the MBTI personality predictor and prompted LLMs with situational questions to assess their personalities.
- The study found that LLMs exhibit different personalities based on different scenarios, unlike humans who show consistent personality profiles in different situations.

### Major Findings:
1. LLMs exhibit different personalities when generating posts versus comments, unlike humans who show consistent personality profiles in these two different situations.
2. The study fine-tuned a Llama2-7B for MBTI personality detection that significantly outperformed state-of-the-art models.
3. The authors called for a re-evaluation of personality definition and measurement in LLMs.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study raises important concerns about the reliability and validity of self-assessment tests for measuring LLM personalities.
- The external personality evaluation method used in the study may introduce uncertainties due to error rates in the personality detection model.
- The article does not provide an alternative for defining LLM personality and the measurement method, leaving it for future work.
