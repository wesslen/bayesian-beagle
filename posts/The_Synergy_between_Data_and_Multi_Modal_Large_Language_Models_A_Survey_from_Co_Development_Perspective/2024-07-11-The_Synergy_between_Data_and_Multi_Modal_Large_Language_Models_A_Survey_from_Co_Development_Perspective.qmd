**Summary:**

The paper discusses the development of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and the importance of data in their performance. The authors propose a new taxonomy that emphasizes the synergy between multi-modal data and MLLMs, aiming to understand and mine the mutual benefits for both data and model development. The taxonomy is organized based on the hierarchy of data-related technologies essential for developing MLLMs. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of existing works related to MLLMs from the data-model co-development perspective and a regularly maintained project associated with this survey.

**Major Findings:**

1. The development of MLLMs and data is interconnected, with larger and higher-quality data contributing to better performance of MLLMs, and MLLMs facilitating the development of data.
2. The co-development of multi-modal data and MLLMs requires a clear view of which specific data-centric approaches can enhance which capabilities of MLLMs, and how the capabilities of MLLMs can assist in multi-modal data.
3. The paper provides a comprehensive review of existing works for MLLMs from the data-model co-development perspective, focusing on the data contributions to MLLMs and the contributions of MLLMs to data.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper provides a comprehensive review of the development of MLLMs and the importance of data in their performance. The proposed taxonomy and the review of existing works offer a new perspective for MLLM development and a roadmap for future research. However, the paper does not discuss the limitations or potential biases in the reviewed works, which could be a topic for future research. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential ethical implications of MLLMs, which is an important consideration in the development and deployment of these models.
