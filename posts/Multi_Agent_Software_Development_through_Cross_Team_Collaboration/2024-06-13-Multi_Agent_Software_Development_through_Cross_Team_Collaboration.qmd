### Summary:

The paper introduces Cross-Team Collaboration (CTC), a scalable multi-team framework that enables orchestrated teams to jointly propose various decisions and communicate with their insights in a cross-team collaboration environment for superior content generation. The framework is designed to address the limitations of single-team collaboration, which can only execute all phases sequentially according to its pre-defined team configuration, leading to repetitive errors and preventing self-correction. CTC enables different teams to concurrently propose task-oriented decisions as insights for content generation (single-team proposal) and then communicate for insights interchange in some important phases (multi-team aggregation). The experimental results in software development reveal a notable increase in quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the efficacy of the framework. The significant improvements in story generation demonstrate the promising generalization ability of the framework across various domains.

### Major Findings:

1. Cross-team communication for insights interchange significantly improves software quality, indicating the effectiveness of multi-team task handling. It mainly contributes to an appropriate increase in the diversity and effective grouping of content.
2. As the number of participating teams increases, the quality of software is subject to diminishing returns and may even deteriorate. In our study, this is primarily attributed to the increased probability of low-quality software with more teams, which adversely affects the aggregated software quality. The pruning mechanism we introduced effectively addresses this issue.
3. Our CTC framework has the potential for development in broader content generation domains, including natural language generation and programming language generation.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents an innovative approach to multi-team collaboration for content generation, particularly in software development and story generation. The proposed framework, CTC, addresses the limitations of single-team collaboration by enabling multiple teams to work concurrently and communicate for insights interchange. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in improving software quality and story generation.

However, the paper does not discuss the potential challenges and limitations of the CTC framework. For instance, managing the communication and coordination among multiple teams can be complex and resource-intensive. Additionally, the framework's scalability and adaptability to different domains and tasks need further investigation. The paper also does not provide a detailed comparison with other multi-
