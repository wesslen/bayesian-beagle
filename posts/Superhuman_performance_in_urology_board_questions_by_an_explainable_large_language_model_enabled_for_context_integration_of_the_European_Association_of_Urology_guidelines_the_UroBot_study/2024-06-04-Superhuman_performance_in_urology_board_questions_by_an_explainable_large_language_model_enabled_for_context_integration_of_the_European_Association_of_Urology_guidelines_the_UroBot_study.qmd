**Summary:**

The study introduces UroBot, a urology-specialized chatbot based on the GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o models of OpenAI. UroBot utilizes retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and the 2023 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines to provide context-based answers. The performance of UroBot was evaluated against GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Uro_Chat using 200 European Board of Urology (EBU) In-Service Assessment (ISA) questions. UroBot-4o achieved the highest Rate of Correct Answers (RoCA) with an average of 88.4%, outperforming GPT-4o by 10.8% and demonstrating the highest level of agreement between runs
