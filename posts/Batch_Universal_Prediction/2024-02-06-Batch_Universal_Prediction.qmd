### Summary:
- Large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity for generating human-like English sentences.
- LLMs are predictors that estimate the probability of a sequence of words given the past.
- The article introduces the notion of batch regret and studies its asymptotical value for add-constant predictors in memoryless and first-order Markov sources.

### Major Findings:
1. LLMs are essentially predictors that estimate the probability of the next words in an online fashion.
2. The article introduces the concept of batch regret as a modification of the classical average regret to evaluate LLMs from a universal prediction perspective.
3. The study focuses on the asymptotical batch regret for add-constant predictors in memoryless and first-order Markov sources.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article provides valuable insights into the evaluation of large language models from a universal prediction perspective.
- However, the article lacks practical examples or applications of the proposed concepts.
- The theoretical nature of the study may limit its immediate applicability in real-world scenarios.
- Further research is needed to validate the proposed concepts in practical settings and to explore their potential impact on language model evaluation.
