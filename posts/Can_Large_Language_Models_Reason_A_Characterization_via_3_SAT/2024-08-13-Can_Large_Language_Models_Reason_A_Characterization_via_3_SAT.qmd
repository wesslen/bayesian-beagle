title: "Can Large Language Models Reason? A Characterization via 3-SAT"
id: "2408.07215v1"
description: "[TEXT] This study examines the impact of climate change on the migration patterns of polar bears in the Arctic. Results indicate that as sea ice continues to decline, polar bears are increasingly forced to travel longer distances to find food, leading to declines in body condition and reproductive success.

[TL;DR] Climate change forces polar bears to travel more for food, reducing their health and reproduction."

### Summary:

The study evaluates the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by examining their performance on solving 3-SAT problems, a fundamental problem in computer science and reasoning. The authors focus on Leon Bottou's definition of reasoning, which is "the algebraic manipulation of previously acquired knowledge in order to answer a new question." The 3-SAT problem is introduced, and its significance as an NP-complete problem is discussed. The authors aim to clarify the ambiguous picture of LLMs' reasoning abilities by evaluating their performance on 3-SAT problems.

### Major Findings:

1. LLMs can solve certain types of 3-SAT problems, but their performance varies across different problem complexities. GPT-4, for instance, demonstrates proficiency in identifying unSAT scenarios but occasionally misclassifies SAT problems as unSAT, particularly within the Hard region of Î±.
2. The input type (SAT-Menu or SAT-CNF) does not significantly impact the performance of LLMs. However, prompt engineering techniques, such as in-context learning, can enhance LLM performance, although the gains are not consistent across all problem phases.
3. Integrating a solver with LLMs, such as GPT-4, can significantly enhance their problem-solving capabilities. This approach, termed SAT-Translate, involves using an LLM to translate a natural language task into a solver-compliant formula and then applying a solver for solution derivation.

### Analysis and Critique:

The study provides valuable insights into the reasoning abilities of LLMs by evaluating their performance on 3-SAT problems. However, several limitations and unanswered questions remain:

1. The study focuses on a specific type of reasoning (search-based reasoning) and does not explore other domains, such as commonsense reasoning. The findings may not generalize to other types of reasoning tasks.
2. The study does not address the potential biases or limitations of the LLMs used in the experiments. For instance, the training data and architecture of the LLMs could influence their performance on 3-SAT problems.
3. The study does not discuss the potential implications of the findings for the development and application of LLMs in various fields.
