# Summary

## Major Takeaways
1. The paper proposes a new algorithm, **Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance Attack (JMA)**, for crafting targeted adversarial examples against Deep Learning classifiers.
2. JMA presents a more general and theoretically sound approach, resorting to the minimization of a **Mahalanobis distance term** derived from the Jacobian matrix, taking into account the effort required to move the input sample in a given direction in the latent space representation.
3. The experiments confirm the efficacy of JMA under different scenarios, including multi-label classification, ECOC output encoding, and one-hot encoding.

- The JMA Attack

## Critique
The paper introduces a novel and theoretically sound algorithm that addresses a significant issue in crafting targeted adversarial examples. The experimental results support the effectiveness of JMA across different scenarios. However, a critical analysis of the limitations or potential failure cases of JMA would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its applicability. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art algorithms would enhance the paper's contributions and provide additional context for evaluating the significance of JMA.
