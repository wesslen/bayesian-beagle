# Summary:

**PhysioLLM: Supporting Personalized Health Insights with Wearables and Large Language Models**

PhysioLLM is an interactive system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to provide personalized health understanding and exploration by integrating physiological data from wearables with contextual information. Unlike commercial health apps for wearables, PhysioLLM offers a comprehensive statistical analysis component that discovers correlations and trends in user data, allowing users to ask questions in natural language and receive generated personalized insights, and guides them to develop actionable goals.

## Major Findings:

1. **Improved Understanding of Health Data**: PhysioLLM outperforms both the Fitbit App alone and a generic LLM chatbot in facilitating a deeper, personalized understanding of health data.
2. **Personalized Insights**: The system provides effective personalized insights using an LLM architecture, which improves oneâ€™s understanding of their own health.
3. **Actionable Steps Toward Personal Health Goals**: The interface is perceived as more personalized than chatting with a generic LLM-based chatbot, and it results in users having more motivation to change and their goals being found to be more actionable.

## Analysis and Critique:

- **Limited Expert Health Knowledge**: The system uses an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM, which has limited expert health knowledge. Integrations of fine-tuned specialized LLMs with the system will further improve the quality of the insights.
- **Handling Randomness and Unknowns**: The system has limitations in handling the randomness and unknowns in the data and contexts. However, its adaptability ensures beneficial and personalized suggestions.
- **Potential for Positive Behavior Change**: Anecdotal evidence suggests that the system has the potential to nudge people towards positive behavior change, which merits further study.
- **Privacy and Ethical Considerations**: The system has embedded counter-action prompts to prevent abusive uses, but further tests on the robustness of the safety prompt are needed. The system should acknowledge its limitations and ensure that no raw data is sent to the LLM, and all data and survey results are de-identified.
- **Broader User
