# Neural Contextual Bandits for Personalized Recommendation

## **Key Findings**

1. Contextual bandits offer an effective framework for personalized recommendations in online businesses, addressing the shortcomings of static supervised learning methods and the "Matthew Effect" in recommender systems.
2. Neural contextual bandits have emerged as a crucial branch, leveraging the representation power of neural networks to tackle non-linear problem settings in the realm of contextual bandits for personalized recommendation.
3. This tutorial aims to provide an extensive review of advanced algorithms and theories, collaborative strategies, and open challenges in the field of neural contextual bandits for personalized recommendation.

## **Introduction**

- Recommender systems play a crucial role in online businesses, traditionally relying on static supervised learning methods.
- The ideal recommender system should adapt over time, prompting the formulation of the recommendation process as a sequential decision-making process.
- Contextual bandits and neural contextual bandits have been introduced as techniques to address the challenges of balancing exploitation and exploration in personalized recommendation.

## **Target Audience**

- The tutorial targets individuals interested in multi-armed bandits, reinforcement learning, information retrieval, data mining, and recommender systems, with a balance of introductory and advanced material.

## **Short Bio of Presenters**

- Yikun Ban, Yunzhe Qi, and Jingrui He are experienced researchers and practitioners with expertise in multi-armed bandits, reinforcement learning, and personalized recommendation systems.

## **Outline**

- The tutorial comprises four parts: the introduction, linear contextual bandits, neural contextual bandits, collaborative contextual bandits, and open questions and future trends.
- Each part includes a deep dive into various algorithms, theories, and applications of contextual bandits in personalized recommendation settings.

## **Related Tutorials or Talks**

- Contrasting with other industry and academic tutorials, this tutorial focuses specifically on neural contextual bandits and collaborative contextual bandits for personalized recommendation.

## **Previous Editions**

- This tutorial marks the first edition, but the presenters have prior experience in teaching material covering similar topics.

## **Critique**

The abstract and outline provide a comprehensive overview of the tutorial's content, but the abstract could be more succinct. Additionally, the excessive focus on the presenters' achievements might detract from the tutorial's core content. The lack of specific case studies or real-world applications of the discussed algorithms and theories could limit the practical applicability of the tutorial.
