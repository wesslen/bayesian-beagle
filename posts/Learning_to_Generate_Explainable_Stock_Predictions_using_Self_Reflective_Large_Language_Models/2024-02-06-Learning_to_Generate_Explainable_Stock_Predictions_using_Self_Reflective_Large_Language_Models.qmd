### Summary:
- The article proposes the Summarize-Explain-Predict (SEP) framework to teach Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate explainable stock predictions in a fully autonomous manner. The framework utilizes a verbal self-reflective agent and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to fine-tune the LLM.
- The article demonstrates that the SEP framework outperforms traditional deep-learning and LLM methods in prediction accuracy and explanation quality for stock classification tasks.
- The SEP framework is also validated for portfolio construction tasks, showing its effectiveness in generating explainable weights for a stock portfolio.

### Major Findings:
1. The SEP framework outperforms traditional deep-learning and LLM methods in prediction accuracy and explanation quality for stock classification tasks.
2. The Summarize module reduces noise and length of input texts, leading to better results. The Explain module generates more decisive and correct annotated samples through self-reflection. The Predict module, particularly the PPO reinforcement learning, significantly improves the model's performance.
3. The SEP framework is effective in generating explainable weights for a stock portfolio, outperforming other methods in most portfolio metrics.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article effectively demonstrates the effectiveness of the SEP framework in improving the accuracy and quality of stock predictions, as well as its generalizability to portfolio construction tasks.
- The framework's ability to generate explainable predictions and portfolio weights showcases its potential for practical applications in stock market analysis.
- The article does not address potential ethical implications of using LLMs for stock prediction, such as the risk of manipulation, misinformation, and prediction bias. It would be beneficial to include a more comprehensive discussion of these ethical considerations and potential mitigation strategies.
- The article could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and challenges of the SEP framework, as well as potential future research directions to address these limitations.
