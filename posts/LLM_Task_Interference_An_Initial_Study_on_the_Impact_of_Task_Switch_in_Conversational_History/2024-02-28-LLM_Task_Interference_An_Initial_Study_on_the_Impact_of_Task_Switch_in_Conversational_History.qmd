### **Summary:**
- The study investigates the impact of task-switch in conversational history on large language models (LLMs).
- The authors find that task-switches can lead to significant performance degradation in LLMs.
- The study makes the first attempt to formalize the study of vulnerabilities and interference of tasks in conversational LLMs caused by task-switches in the conversational history.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The study formalizes the risk of performance degradation of LLMs due to task-switch.
2. The impact of task-switch on diverse datasets with more than 15 different task-switches is presented.
3. The study measures the task-switch sensitivity for popular LLMs of different sizes, observing that very large (175B) and small (7B) LLMs can both be susceptible to performance degradation from task-switch.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The study provides valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of LLMs to task-switches in conversational history, shedding light on the potential limitations of these models.
- The limitations of the study include the inability to perform task sensitivity analysis on closed models and the maximum token length constraint, which limited the analysis over extremely long conversations.
- Future work could focus on aligning humans and the model as a metric, which was out of the scope for this paper. Additionally, further research is needed to address the potential biases and vulnerabilities of LLMs to undesired information leakage from the conversation history.
