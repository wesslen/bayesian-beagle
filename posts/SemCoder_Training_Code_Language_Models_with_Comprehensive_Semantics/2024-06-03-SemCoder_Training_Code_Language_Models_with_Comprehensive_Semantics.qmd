# Summary:

The paper "SEMCODER: Training Code Language Models with Comprehensive Semantics" introduces a novel strategy to train Code LLMs with comprehensive semantics, including high-level functional descriptions, local execution effects of individual statements, and overall input/output behavior. The authors propose training Code LLMs to write code and represent and reason about execution behaviors using natural language, mimicking human verbal debugging. The paper presents SEMCODER, a Code LLM with only 6.7B parameters, which shows competitive performance with GPT-3.5-turbo on code generation and execution reasoning tasks.

## Major Findings:

1. The paper introduces a novel strategy to train Code LLMs with comprehensive semantics, including high-level functional descriptions, local execution effects of individual statements, and overall input/output behavior.
2. The authors propose training Code LLMs to write code and represent and reason about execution behaviors using natural language, mimicking human verbal debugging.
3. The paper presents SEMCODER, a Code LLM with only 6.7B parameters, which shows competitive performance with GPT-3.5-turbo on code generation and execution reasoning tasks.
4. SEMCODER achieves 81.1% on HumanEval (GPT-3.5-turbo: 76.8%) and 54.5% on CRUXEval-I (GPT-3.5-turbo: 50.3%).
5. The paper also studies the effectiveness of SEMCODER's monologue-style execution reasoning compared to concrete scratchpad reasoning, showing that their approach integrates semantics from multiple dimensions more smoothly.

## Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel approach to training Code LLMs with comprehensive semantics, which has the potential to improve the performance of Code LLMs on code generation and execution reasoning tasks. The authors' proposal to train Code LLMs to write code and represent and reason about execution behaviors using natural language is an interesting and promising direction.

However, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison of SEMCODER with other state-of-the-art Code LLMs, which makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach. Additionally, the
