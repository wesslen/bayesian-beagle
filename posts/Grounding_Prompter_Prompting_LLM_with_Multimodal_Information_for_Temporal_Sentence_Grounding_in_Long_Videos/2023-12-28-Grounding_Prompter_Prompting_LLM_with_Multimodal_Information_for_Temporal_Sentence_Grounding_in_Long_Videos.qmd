### Summary of "Grounding-Prompter: Prompting LLM with Multimodal Information for Temporal Sentence Grounding in Long Videos"

#### Major Takeaways
1. The paper introduces the "Grounding-Prompter" method to tackle Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) in long videos through prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal information. It effectively addresses the challenges of temporal reasoning over longer moment sequences and handling rich multimodal information.
2. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in TSG, demonstrating the benefits of prompting LLM with multimodal information in long videos.
3. The research offers innovative contributions in reformulating TSG into a long-textual task, integrating textual speech and visual modalities to LLMs, and proposing a Boundary-Perceptive Prompting strategy for enhancing temporal reasoning.

#### Introduction
- TSG aims to localize moments from videos based on natural language queries, posing challenges in long videos such as complicated contexts and multiple modalities.
- Existing TSG methods are inadequate for long videos due to computational costs, fitting bias, and incapability to capture rich semantics from textual speeches.
- The paper addresses these challenges by proposing the Grounding-Prompter method to prompt LLM with multimodal information for TSG in long videos.

#### Proposed Method: Grounding-Prompter
- **Compressed Task Textualization**: The TSG task and its multimodal inputs are transformed into compressed textualized representations to feed LLM, utilizing speech transcriptions and visual captions.
- **Boundary-Perceptive Prompting**: A novel strategy is introduced to enhance LLM's temporal reasoning under complicated contexts, including a multiscale denoising Chain-of-Thought, validity principles, and one-shot In-Context-Learning.
- **Prompt Example**: A detailed prompt example is provided to illustrate the methodology of prompting LLM with task-specific content.

#### Related Works
- The paper discusses literature on TSG methods, large language models, and long video understanding, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches in handling TSG in long videos.

#### Experiments
- The proposed method is compared with rule-based, Multimodal Large Language Models for Videos (MLLM-V), and state-of-the-art TSG models on the VidChapters-mini dataset, demonstrating superior performance in training-free settings.
- Ablation studies and qualitative analysis are conducted to evaluate the key components of the Grounding-Prompter method and showcase its effectiveness in leveraging multimodal information and boundary-adept prompting strategy.

### Critique
The paper provides valuable insights into addressing TSG in long videos using LLMs and multimodal information. However, the proposed method's performance in training-based settings and its scalability to larger and more diverse datasets could be further explored. Additionally, the ablation studies could benefit from a more extensive analysis of the individual contributions of each proposed component to provide a clearer understanding of their impact.
