### **Summary:**
The article introduces a new web threat called WIPI, which indirectly controls Web Agents to execute malicious instructions embedded in publicly accessible webpages. The authors propose a novel threat model and methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of the attack. They conduct extensive experiments using various web plugins, Web GPTs, and open-source Web Agents to demonstrate the high success rate of the attack.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The WIPI attack achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) exceeding 90% across different Web Agents.
2. The proposed methodology exhibits strong robustness, maintaining high performance across diverse prefix instructions.
3. The attack is effective in redirecting Web Agents to malicious websites, promoting deceptive phishing links, and rendering and displaying misleading content.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The article provides a comprehensive analysis of the WIPI attack, highlighting the potential security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven Web Agents.
- The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack across various Web Agents, indicating the urgent need for more secure Web Agents.
- The study overlooks the potential ethical implications and real-world consequences of the WIPI attack, which could have significant impacts on user privacy and security.
- The article lacks a discussion of potential countermeasures or mitigation strategies to defend against the WIPI attack, which could limit its practical applicability.

Overall, the article provides valuable insights into a new web threat and its implications for LLM-driven Web Agents. However, further research is needed to address the ethical and security implications of the WIPI attack and develop effective defense mechanisms.
