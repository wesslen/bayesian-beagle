### **Summary:**
- Large language models (LLMs) have received extensive attention for their exceptional performance in logical reasoning and symbolic inference.
- This paper investigates the reasoning capabilities of LLMs on two logical reasoning datasets using counterfactual methods to replace context text and modify logical concepts.
- The findings suggest that LLMs do not truly understand logical rules; rather, in-context learning has simply enhanced the likelihood of these models arriving at the correct answers.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The Chain of Thought (COT) in-context examples markedly improve the performance of large-scale models on logical reasoning tasks.
2. Large models demonstrate resilience to distracting elements within in-context examples, such as extraneous text, reasoning chains, and patterns.
3. Large models do not genuinely comprehend logical principles; rather, they rely on probabilistic associations between input examples and outputs.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The study highlights the limitations of LLMs in truly understanding logical rules, despite their exceptional performance in logical reasoning tasks.
- The findings suggest that the success of LLMs in logical reasoning tasks may be attributed to in-context learning and probabilistic associations rather than genuine comprehension of logical principles.
- The study raises questions about the effectiveness of current pre-training mechanisms for LLMs in addressing logical reasoning tasks and suggests the need for alternative pre-training strategies tailored to these requirements.
- The paper also explores methods to enhance the modelâ€™s logical reasoning capabilities independent of context-based examples, providing insights for future research in this area.
