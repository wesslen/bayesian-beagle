### Summary:

- The study explores the possibility of forming human-machine teams, where humans can contribute to and make the overall team better even when their performance is worse on average than their machine teammates.
- The research focuses on a knowledge-intensive task where large language models (LLMs) surpass humans in predicting the outcomes of neuroscience studies.
- The authors propose a novel and resource-efficient procedure for human-LLM teaming, which comprises a logistic-regression-based strategy that provides confidence-weighted integration of teammates’ predictions for any number of team members.
- The study uses BrainBench, a benchmark that includes 100 test cases generated by GPT-4, to assess the capacity of humans and LLMs to predict the outcomes of neuroscience studies.
- The results show that human-LLM teams achieve complementarity, with their combined performance besting that of either teammate alone. This is achieved because two critical conditions are satisfied: confidence is well-calibrated, and classification diversity holds among teammates.
- The authors' confidence-weighted regression approach performs better than a Bayesian approach, with advantages including ease of implementation, very fast runtime, an interpretable solution, and the ability to extend to any number of teammates.

### Major Findings:

1. Human-LLM teams can achieve complementarity, with their combined performance besting that of either teammate alone.
2. Two critical conditions for complementarity are satisfied: confidence is well-calibrated, and classification diversity holds among teammates.
3. The authors' confidence-weighted regression approach performs better than a Bayesian approach, with advantages including ease of implementation, very fast runtime, an interpretable solution, and the ability to extend to any number of teammates.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The study provides a promising approach to human-machine teaming, demonstrating that humans can contribute to and make the overall team better even when their performance is worse on average than their machine teammates.
- The use of BrainBench as a benchmark for assessing the capacity of humans and LLMs to predict the outcomes of neuroscience studies is a strength of the study.
- The authors' confidence-weighted regression approach is a significant contribution to the field, as it outper
