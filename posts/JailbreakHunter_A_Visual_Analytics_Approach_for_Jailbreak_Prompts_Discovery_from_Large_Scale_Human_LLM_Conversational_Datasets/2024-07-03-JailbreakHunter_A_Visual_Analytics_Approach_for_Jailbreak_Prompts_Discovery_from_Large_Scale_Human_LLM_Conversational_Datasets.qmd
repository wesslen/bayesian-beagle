### Summary:

The paper introduces JailbreakHunter, a visual analytics approach designed to identify jailbreak prompts in large-scale human-LLM conversational datasets. Jailbreak prompts are a popular type of adversarial attack towards LLMs, which can bypass the system's safety protocols. The approach consists of three levels of analysis: group-level, conversation-level, and turn-level. The group-level analysis enables users to grasp the distribution of conversations and identify suspicious conversations using multiple criteria. The conversation-level analysis facilitates understanding the progress of conversations and helps discover jailbreak prompts within their conversation contexts. The turn-level analysis allows users to explore the semantic similarity and token overlap between a single-turn prompt and the reported jailbreak prompts, aiding in the identification of new jailbreak strategies. The effectiveness and usability of the system were verified through multiple case studies and expert interviews.

### Major Findings:

1. JailbreakHunter assists users in quickly identifying jailbreak prompts from large-scale human-LLM conversational datasets.
2. The system enables users to set up filters to extract conversations with malicious content, providing an initial filter to extract conversations of interest for further investigation.
3. JailbreakHunter supports the three levels of analysis and assists LLM researchers in identifying jailbreak prompts within large-scale human-LLM conversational datasets.
4. The system has been demonstrated to be effective and usable in identifying jailbreak prompts within large-scale human-LLM conversational datasets through case studies and expert interviews.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a well-structured and coherent summary of the JailbreakHunter approach, providing a clear explanation of its purpose and functionality. The use of visual analytics to identify jailbreak prompts in large-scale human-LLM conversational datasets is a novel and valuable contribution to the field. The three levels of analysis provide a comprehensive approach to identifying jailbreak prompts, allowing users to explore the data from different perspectives.

However, the paper does not provide a detailed evaluation of the system's performance, such as its accuracy in identifying jailbreak prompts or its efficiency in processing large-scale datasets. Additionally, the paper does not discuss any potential limitations or biases in the system's
