### Summary:
The article discusses the use of large language models (LLMs) for document understanding tasks. It explores the possibility of using purely text-based LLMs for document-specific tasks by using layout enrichment. The study investigates different verbalization strategies and their impact on the performance of LLMs. The results indicate that layout enrichment can improve the performance of purely text-based LLMs for document understanding by up to 15% compared to just using plain document text.

### Major Findings:
1. The study demonstrates that using layout enrichment can improve the performance of purely text-based LLMs for document understanding by up to 15% compared to just using plain document text.
2. The SpatialFormat verbalization strategy is found to be the most effective among the ones tested, introducing the least token overhead compared to the other verbalizers.
3. The addition of a verbalizer-specific format description in the prompt did not lead to a significant performance gain, and in some cases, it actually led to a decline in performance.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study provides valuable insights into the use of LLMs for document understanding tasks and highlights the importance of layout enrichment in improving the performance of text-based LLMs.
- The findings of the study have practical implications for the development of document understanding models and can guide future research in this area.
- However, the study could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of the limitations and potential biases associated with the use of LLMs for document understanding tasks. Additionally, further research is needed to explore the benefits and trade-offs of including visual input in LLMs for document understanding.
