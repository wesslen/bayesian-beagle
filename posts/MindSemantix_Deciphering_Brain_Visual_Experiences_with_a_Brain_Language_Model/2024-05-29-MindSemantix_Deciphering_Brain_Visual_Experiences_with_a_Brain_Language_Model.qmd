### Summary:

- MindSemantix is a novel multi-modal framework that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend visually-evoked semantic content in brain activity.
- The framework consists of three modules: Brain Encoder, Brain-Text Transformer, and Text Decoder, with the frozen Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT) as the backbone.
- MindSemantix provides more feasibility to downstream brain decoding tasks such as stimulus reconstruction and generates high-quality captions deeply rooted in visual and semantic information derived from brain activity.
- The Brain Encoder is pre-trained using large-scale cross-subject fMRI data via self-supervised learning, and the Brain-Text Transformer adopts a Brain Q-Former to guarantee training efficiency.
- The code for MindSemantix will be publicly released at <https://github.com/ziqiren/MindSemantix>.

### Major Findings:

1. MindSemantix is the first work to construct an end-to-end decoding model specialized for brain captioning via fMRI.
2. Engaging LLMs into the brain activity comprehension, not just limited to the text generation, fills in the blank of empowering LLMs with the capability of understanding brain visual perception.
3. State-of-the-art brain captioning performance can be obtained, quantitatively demonstrated on both low-level and high-level text metrics.
4. A convenient platform for potential downstream tasks like stimulus reconstruction is presented by flexibly assembling with advanced generation models.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The study presents a novel approach to brain captioning using LLMs, which has shown significant improvements over previous methods.
- The use of self-supervised learning for pre-training the Brain Encoder and the Brain-Text Transformer with a Brain Q-Former are innovative solutions to the challenges of multi-modal alignment and sample scarcity in fMRI data.
- The study could benefit from further exploration of the potential of LLMs in generating captions and their impact on downstream tasks such as stimulus reconstruction.
- The authors acknowledge the limitations of their work, including the need for more ground-truth caption
