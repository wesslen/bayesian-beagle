### Summary:

This paper investigates the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to support autonomous driving in connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The authors propose a new approach where CAVs send driving assistance requests to LLMs, which are then processed and generate driving assistance instructions. The key issue is assessing LLMs on their understanding of driving theory and skills to ensure they are qualified for safety-critical driving assistance tasks.

The authors design and run driving theory tests for several proprietary LLM models (OpenAI GPT models, Baidu Ernie, and Ali QWen) and open-source LLM models (Tsinghua MiniCPM-2B and MiniCPM-Llama3-V2.5) using more than 500 multiple-choice theory test questions. The results show that while model GPT-4 passes the test with improved domain knowledge, other LLM models, including GPT-3.5, fail the test. For test questions with images, the multimodal model GPT4-o has an excellent accuracy result of 96%, and the MiniCPM-Llama3-V2.5 achieves an accuracy of 76%.

### Major Findings:

1. Model GPT-4 passes the driving theory test with improved domain knowledge, while other LLM models, including GPT-3.5, fail the test.
2. For test questions with images, the multimodal model GPT4-o has an excellent accuracy result of 96%, and the MiniCPM-Llama3-V2.5 achieves an accuracy of 76%.
3. While GPT-4 holds stronger potential for CAV driving assistance applications, the cost of using model GPT4 is much higher, almost 50 times that of using GPT-3.5.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper provides a novel approach to using LLMs for CAV driving assistance, but there are some limitations and unanswered questions. The authors acknowledge that the cost of using GPT-4 is much higher than that of using GPT-3.5, which may limit its practical application. Additionally, the paper only focuses on the multiple-choice theory test and does not address the hazard perception test, which
