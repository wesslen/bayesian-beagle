### **Summary:**
- The article evaluates the performance of Gemini-Pro-Vision in generating contract code summarization from multimodal inputs.
- It compares Gemini-Pro-Vision to MMTrans and explores the use of multimodal prompts to generate contract code summarization.
- The study uses widely used metrics (BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L) to measure the quality of the generated summarization.

### **Major Findings:**
1. Gemini-Pro-Vision achieves 21.17% and 21.05% scores for code comments generated by three-shot prompts, which are better than those generated by one-shot and five-shot prompts.
2. The performance of Gemini-Pro-Vision is compared to MMTrans, and it is found that MMTrans significantly outperforms Gemini in terms of METEOR, BLEU, and ROUGE-L.
3. The length of comments generated by Gemini-Pro-Vision with one-shot prompts is lower than those generated by three-shot and five-shot prompts.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- **Benefits:**
  - Gemini-Pro-Vision's code comments are more concise and exhibit a stronger reasoning ability.
- **Limitations:**
  - Lack of a high-quality benchmark dataset for evaluating Gemini-Pro-Vision's performance.
  - Absence of suitable metrics for evaluating comments generated by LLMs such as Gemini-Pro-Vision.

The article provides valuable insights into the performance of Gemini-Pro-Vision in generating contract code summarization. However, it also highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark dataset and suitable evaluation metrics for LLMs-generated comments. Additionally, the study's comparison with MMTrans indicates the need for further improvements in Gemini-Pro-Vision's performance. Further research is required to address these limitations and enhance the capabilities of Gemini-Pro-Vision for generating code comments.
