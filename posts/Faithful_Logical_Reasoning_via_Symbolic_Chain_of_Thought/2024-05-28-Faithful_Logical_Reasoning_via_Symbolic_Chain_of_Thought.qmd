# Summary:

The paper introduces a novel Symbolic Chain-of-Thought (SymbCoT) framework for logical reasoning, which integrates symbolic expressions and logic rules with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. SymbCoT is a fully LLM-based framework that translates natural language context into symbolic format, derives a step-by-step plan to solve the problem with symbolic logical rules, and includes a verifier to check the translation and reasoning chain. The paper demonstrates that SymbCoT significantly improves the reasoning capabilities of vanilla CoT and outperforms current state-of-the-art solutions, offering better robustness against translation errors and more human-understandable explanations.

## Major Findings:

1. The Symbolic Chain-of-Thought (SymbCoT) framework significantly improves the reasoning capabilities of vanilla CoT and outper
