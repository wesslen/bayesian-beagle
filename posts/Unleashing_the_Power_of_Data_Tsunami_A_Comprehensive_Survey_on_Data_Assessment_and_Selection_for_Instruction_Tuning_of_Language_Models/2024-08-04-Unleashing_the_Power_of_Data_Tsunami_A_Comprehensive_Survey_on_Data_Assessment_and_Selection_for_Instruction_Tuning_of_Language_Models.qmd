**Summary:**

This paper presents a comprehensive review of existing literature on data assessment and selection methods for instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs). The study aims to unify a wide array of methods under the context of instruction tuning and categorize them into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based methods. The paper also discusses the limitations of existing methods and proposes promising avenues for future studies.

**Major Findings:**

1. Existing resourceful data assessment methods can be categorized into three main perspectives: quality, diversity, and importance.
2. A systematic view of selection methods can be unified even though they exhibit coupling with the assessment techniques.
3. Quality, diversity, and importance might be used interchangeably without strict discrimination in previous studies, but the present survey provides a rationalized organization taxonomy for structured elaboration.
4. Despite the goal of being comprehensive, the present survey only provides details of certain typical, representative methods to avoid being tediously long.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper provides a comprehensive review of existing literature on data assessment and selection methods for instruction tuning of LLMs. The study categorizes the methods into three main perspectives: quality, diversity, and importance, providing a rationalized organization taxonomy for structured elaboration. However, the paper only provides details of certain typical, representative methods to avoid being tediously long. The paper also discusses the limitations of existing methods and proposes promising avenues for future studies.

One potential limitation of the study is that it does not provide a detailed analysis of the performance of each method. The paper only reports the performance of typical data selection methods and provides discussions on the comparison between these methods. Future studies could provide a more detailed analysis of the performance of each method and compare their strengths and weaknesses.

Another potential limitation is that the paper does not discuss the scalability of the methods. With the increasing size of LLMs, it is important to consider the scalability of the data assessment and selection methods. Future studies could investigate the scalability of the methods and propose solutions to improve their scalability.

In conclusion, the paper provides a comprehensive review of existing literature on data assessment and selection methods for instruction tuning of LLMs. The study categorizes the methods into three main perspectives: quality, diversity, and importance,
