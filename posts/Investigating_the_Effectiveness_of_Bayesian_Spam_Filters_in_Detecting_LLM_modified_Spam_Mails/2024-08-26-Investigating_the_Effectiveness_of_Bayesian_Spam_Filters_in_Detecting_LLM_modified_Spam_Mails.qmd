# Summary:
**Investigating the Effectiveness of Bayesian Spam Filters in Detecting LLM-modified Spam Mails**

This study aims to evaluate the robustness and effectiveness of SpamAssassin, a Bayesian spam filter, against LLM-modified email content. The researchers developed a pipeline to test the vulnerability of SpamAssassin in classifying LLM-modified spam emails correctly. The results show that SpamAssassin misclassified up to 73.7% of LLM-modified spam emails as legitimate, compared to a simpler dictionary-replacement attack, which showed a maximum success rate of only 0.4%. These findings highlight the significant threat posed by LLM-modified spam, especially given the cost-efficiency of such attacks (0.17 cents per email).

## Major Findings:
1. **LLM-modified spam emails bypass traditional spam filters**: The study found that LLM-modified spam emails can evade traditional spam filters, with SpamAssassin misclassifying up to 73.7% of these emails as legitimate.
2. **Cost-efficiency of LLM-modified spam attacks**: The cost-efficiency of LLM-modified spam attacks (0.17 cents per email) makes them a significant threat to cybersecurity.
3. **Limited effectiveness of simpler attacks**: Simpler attacks, such as dictionary-replacement attacks, have limited effectiveness in bypassing spam filters, with a maximum success rate of only 0.4%.

## Analysis and Critique:
- The study provides valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of current spam filters against LLM-modified spam emails. However, it only evaluates SpamAssassin, and the results may not be generalizable to other spam filters.
- The study uses a dataset that is almost 20 years old, which may not accurately represent the current state of spam emails. The use of more recent datasets could provide a more accurate evaluation of the effectiveness of LLM-modified spam emails.
- The study does not consider the potential impact of LLM-modified spam emails on users, such as the potential for these emails to be more convincing and therefore more likely to result in successful phishing attacks.
