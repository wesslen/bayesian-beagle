## Major Findings

- Specific types of **instructions** are more beneficial for particular uses, while they may cause harm to other aspects. 
- Evaluating models with diverse benchmarks and alignment skills yielded insights into the impact of different **distributions** of instruction datasets on model performance across diverse aspects. 
- Results suggest that researchers should carefully design the **instruction mixture** to maximize the model's performance on the target usage, taking model size into consideration.

## Experimental Setup

- **Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)** has been proven to be an effective approach to align large language models (LLMs) with human instructions, enhancing downstream task performance and facilitating code generation.
- The study focused on evaluating the modelâ€™s performance in three key areas: **NLP downstream task performance**, **coding ability**, and **chat capabilities**.
- Experiments were conducted using eight different **mixture settings** involving instruction datasets for NLP downstream tasks, code generation, and general-purpose instructions.

## Results

- Different types of specialized instructions improved the performance on the benchmarks they were designed for. 
- Incorporating general instructions consistently improved coding performance, and larger models could better leverage various instructions. 
- The mixture of instruction datasets had a significant impact on alignment skills, with general instructions providing better alignment skills and performance on NLP benchmarks.
  
## Critique

The paper's potential limitations include:
- Limited use of only LLaMA-2 7B and 13B models in the experiments, with the need for verification using different sizes of models.
- The restriction to a specific instruction dataset size and mainly comparing the 1:1 ratio of all instruction types, leaving the exploration of the impact of more instructions and mixing ratios for future research.

It is important to consider the potential variability in model behavior across different sizes and explore the impact of different instruction dataset sizes and mixing ratios on LLMs' performance for comprehensive understanding.
