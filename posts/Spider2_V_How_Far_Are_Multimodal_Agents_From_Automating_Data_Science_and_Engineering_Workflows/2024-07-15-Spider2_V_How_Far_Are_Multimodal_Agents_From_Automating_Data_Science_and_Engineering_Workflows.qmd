**Summary:**

The paper introduces Spider2-V, a multimodal agent benchmark that covers the entire data science and engineering workflow. It includes 494 real-world tasks in a real-time executable computer environment and 20 professional enterprise data software. The benchmark aims to evaluate a multimodal agent's ability to perform professional data-related tasks by writing code and managing the GUI in enterprise data software systems. The tasks are derived from real-world practices and are supplemented with retrieval-augmented agents with official documentation and tutorials of these software systems. The benchmark is designed to balance realistic simulation with evaluation simplicity and features automatic configurations for task setup and customized evaluation metrics for each task.

**Major Findings:**

1. Existing state-of-the-art LLMs/VLMs-based agents do not reliably automate full data workflows (14.0% success).
2. Even with step-by-step guidance, these agents still underperform in tasks that require fine-grained, knowledge-intensive GUI actions (16.2%) and involve remote cloud-hosted workspaces (10.6%).
3. The empirical evaluation reveals that existing LLMs/VLMs-based agents are far from achieving full data workflow automation.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper presents a comprehensive and well-structured summary of the Spider2-V benchmark. The benchmark is a significant contribution to the field of data science and engineering, as it covers the entire data workflow and integrates visual interfaces. However, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations or potential biases of the benchmark. It would be beneficial to include a more in-depth discussion of these aspects to provide a more balanced perspective on the benchmark's strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing benchmarks in the field, highlighting the unique features and advantages of Spider2-V.
