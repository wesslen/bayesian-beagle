**Summary:**

The study explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the TRIZ-based problem-solving process. The authors construct TRIZ case collections and design a workflow that utilizes step-by-step reasoning and evaluation-validated prompt strategies to transform concrete problems into TRIZ problems and generate inventive solutions. The main contributions of the research include the development of TRIZ case collections, workflow design, and evaluations and case studies.

**Major Findings:**

1. The authors developed two TRIZ case collections: Collection A, which includes 37 classic TRIZ examples, and Collection B, which includes 10 cases published after April 2023.
2. A workflow was designed based on the fundamental approach of TRIZ for problem-solving, utilizing verified prompt strategies for critical stages of contradiction analysis and solution reasoning.
3. Evaluations and case studies were conducted to assess the TRIZ contradiction analysis and solution reasoning capabilities and determine the most applicable strategy. A comparative analysis of the performances of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 during the contradiction analysis stage was also performed.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The study presents a novel approach to addressing the challenges associated with the acquisition and application of TRIZ knowledge by leveraging the extensive knowledge bases and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The use of TRIZ case collections and a specifically designed workflow allows for the transformation of concrete problems into TRIZ problems and the generation of inventive solutions. However, the study does not address potential limitations, unanswered questions, or biases that may have arisen during the research process. Additionally, the methodological issues, conflicting evidence, or areas that require further research or clarification are not discussed. The study could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of the potential problems and shortcomings of the proposed approach.
