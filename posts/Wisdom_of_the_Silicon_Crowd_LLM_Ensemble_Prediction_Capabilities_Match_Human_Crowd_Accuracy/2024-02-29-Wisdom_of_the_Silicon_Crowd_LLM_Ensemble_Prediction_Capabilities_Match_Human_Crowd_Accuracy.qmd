### Summary

- Human forecasting accuracy relies on the 'wisdom of the crowd' effect, where predictions are improved by aggregating across a crowd of individual forecasters.
- Frontier LLMs underperform compared to the gold standard of a human crowd forecasting tournament aggregate, but an ensemble approach of twelve LLMs outperforms a simple no-information benchmark and is statistically equivalent to the human crowd.
- LLM predictions benefit from exposure to the median human prediction as information, improving accuracy by up to 28%.

### Major Findings

1. An LLM ensemble approach consisting of a crowd of twelve LLMs is statistically equivalent to the human crowd in forecasting accuracy.
2. LLM predictions benefit from exposure to the median human prediction as information, improving accuracy by up to 28%.
3. The 'wisdom of the crowd' effect is replicated for LLMs, opening up their use for various applications throughout society.

### Analysis and Critique

- The study does not mention any potential limitations or biases in the LLM ensemble approach.
- The study could benefit from a more thorough discussion on the potential implications and applications of LLMs in forecasting.
- The study could also include a comparison of the LLM ensemble approach to other ensemble methods to provide further context and insight.

**Summary:**

- LLMs can achieve forecasting accuracy rivaling that of human crowd forecasting tournaments through the simple, practically applicable method of forecast aggregation.
- An LLM ensemble approach consisting of a crowd of twelve LLMs is statistically equivalent to the human crowd in forecasting accuracy.
- LLM predictions benefit from exposure to the median human prediction as information, improving accuracy by up to 28%.
