### Summary:
- The paper proposes CoDefeater, an automated process that leverages large language models (LLMs) to find defeaters in assurance cases.
- Defeaters are arguments or evidence that challenge claims in an assurance case, helping to identify weaknesses in the arguments and prompting further investigation.
- The study evaluates the performance of an LLM (ChatGPT) in automated defeater analysis on two complex real-world case studies.
- The experimental results suggest that CoDefeater is a promising approach for identifying and generating novel assurance case defeaters.

### Major Findings:
1. The LLM displayed promising zero-shot capabilities for defeater analysis in assurance cases, completely identifying more than half of all defeaters and partially identifying more than a third in both datasets.
2. The LLM struggled with defeaters that challenged implicit assumptions, as it did not question the underlying assumptions in the claims.
3. LLMs can support practitioners in providing useful and novel defeaters, as demonstrated by the generation of five novel defeaters for the sUAS battery's assurance case.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study focuses on single claims and associated defeaters, and future research should evaluate the performance of LLMs on a combination of claims.
- The LLM can generate creative, redundant, and far-fetched scenarios, and balancing LLM creativity with defeater relevance poses an important challenge.
- The LLM responses not only identified defeaters but also provided helpful rationale and examples, which can assist analysts in understanding and analyzing both a defeater's feasibility and its potential mitigations.
- The study provides preliminary results as a starting point for future research to explore the role of LLMs as a tool to assist with the identification of defeaters toward the development of improved assurance cases.
