# Summary:
**FastGAS: Fast Graph-based Annotation Selection for In-Context Learning**

**Summary:**
- FastGAS is a graph-based selection method designed to efficiently identify high-quality instances for in-context learning (ICL) while minimizing computational overhead.
- The method constructs a data similarity graph based on instance similarities and employs a graph partitioning algorithm to partition the graph into pieces.
- Within each piece, a greedy approach is used to pick the most representative nodes, aggregating nodes from diverse pieces and annotating the corresponding instances.
- FastGAS outperforms prior approaches in terms of performance and significantly reduces selection time.

**Major Findings:**
1. FastGAS improves the overall performance on seven datasets in three types of tasks.
2. For all tasks, FastGAS only needs a few seconds to complete the instance selection process.
3. Theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of the greedy selection algorithm is provided.

**Analysis and Critique:**
- FastGAS addresses the limitation of existing methods, which often require a long time to select instances due to their complexity.
- The method effectively balances the diversity and representativeness of the annotated samples.
- FastGAS significantly reduces the time cost compared to existing methods, making it more practical for real-world applications.
- The method's performance is not affected by the annotation budget, as the most time-intensive processes are not affected by the budget.
- The hyperparameter plays a critical role in graph partitioning, determining the number of components into which the graph is divided.
- The method's performance is not affected by the choice of text embedding models, as it consistently achieves top performance across different embedding models.
- The method's primary constraint is the inability to automatically select the most appropriate number of partitions and the most appropriate number of neighbors during the data similarity graph construction.
- The method's efficiency is enhanced by adopting a greedy selection process that is carried out separately for each piece, but the interrelations between samples across different graph pieces are not explored.
- The method's evaluation is limited to LLMs up to 7B in size due to hardware limitations and available time.
- The method's efficacy with larger
