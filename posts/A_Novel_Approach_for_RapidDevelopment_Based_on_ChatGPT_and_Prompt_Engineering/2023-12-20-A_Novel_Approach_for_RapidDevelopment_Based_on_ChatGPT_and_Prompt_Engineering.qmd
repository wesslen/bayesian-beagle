### **Summary:**
The study explores the use of ChatGPT for code generation and introduces a novel approach called Prompt Engineering (PE) to optimize the code generation process. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of PE in enhancing the performance of ChatGPT in generating code. The results show significant improvements in various metrics, indicating the potential of ChatGPT for practical software development.

### Major Findings:
1. **Effectiveness of Prompt Builder:** The study utilized a Prompt Builder to dynamically generate comprehensive prompts, resulting in a 65.06% improvement in EM, a 38.45% improvement in BLEU, a 15.70% improvement in CodeBLEU, and a 50.64% improvement in Pass@1.
2. **Real Development Scenarios:** In real development scenarios, 98.5% of test cases can be validated through manual validation, highlighting the genuine assistance provided by the ChatGPT-based code generation approach.
3. **Web-Based Code Generation Platform:** The study developed a web-based platform to provide users with code generation services in different programming languages, consisting of a User Interface, Prompt Builder, and Backend Service.

### Analysis and Critique:
The study demonstrates the potential of ChatGPT for code generation, especially when combined with the innovative approach of Prompt Engineering. However, the study also highlights several limitations and challenges, including inherent shortcomings in large-scale pre-training models, the need for standardization of prompts, and the balance between single-turn and multi-turn conversation. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating professional expertise with existing models to unlock their full potential and suggests future research directions to address these limitations.

Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the use of ChatGPT for code generation and the potential of Prompt Engineering to enhance the performance of language models in practical software development. However, it also raises important considerations for future research and development in this area.
