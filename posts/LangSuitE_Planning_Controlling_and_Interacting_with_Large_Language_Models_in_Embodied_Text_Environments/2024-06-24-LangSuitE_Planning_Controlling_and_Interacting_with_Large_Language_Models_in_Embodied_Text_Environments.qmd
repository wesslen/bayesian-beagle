### Summary:

LangSuitE is a versatile and simulation-free testbed designed to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in dynamic interactive environments. It features six representative embodied tasks in textual embodied worlds, offering adaptability to diverse environments without multiple simulation engines. LangSuitE evaluates agents' capacity to develop "internalized world knowledge" with embodied observations and allows easy customization of communication and action strategies. The paper introduces a novel chain-of-thought (CoT) schema, EmMem, which summarizes embodied states with respect to history information. Comprehensive benchmark results illustrate challenges and insights of embodied planning, representing a significant step towards building embodied generalists in the context of language models.

### Major Findings:

1. LangSuitE is a simulation-free testbed that offers adaptability to diverse environments without multiple simulation engines, allowing for the evaluation of LLMs' capabilities across different embodied tasks in textual embodied worlds.
2. The paper introduces EmMem, a novel CoT schema that summarizes embodied states with respect to history information, addressing the embodiment challenge in LLMs.
3. Comprehensive benchmark results demonstrate the challenges and insights of embodied planning, highlighting the potential of LLMs as embodied agents in dynamic interactive environments.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of LangSuitE with other existing testbeds, making it difficult to assess its advantages and limitations in comparison to other approaches.
2. The paper does not discuss the potential biases and limitations of the benchmark results, which could impact the generalizability of the findings.
3. The paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the EmMem schema addresses the embodiment challenge, making it difficult to evaluate its effectiveness in improving LLMs' performance in dynamic interactive environments.
4. The paper does not discuss the potential applications and implications of LLMs as embodied agents in real-world scenarios, which could provide valuable insights into the potential impact of this research.
5. The paper does not provide a clear explanation of the methodology used to generate the benchmark results, making it difficult to assess the validity and reliability of the findings.
6. The paper does not discuss the potential ethical implications of using LL
