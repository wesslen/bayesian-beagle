### **Summary:**
- Large language models (LLMs) are used to adjust the textual difficulty of responses to students in educational applications.
- The study analyzes how LLMs can implicitly adjust text difficulty between user input and its generated text.
- Experimental results show that LLMs can implicitly handle text difficulty between user input and its generated response, sometimes surpassing human ability.

### Major Findings:
1. LLMs can implicitly handle text difficulty between user input and its generated response.
2. Some LLMs can surpass humans in handling text difficulty.
3. Instruction-tuning is important for LLMs to adjust text difficulty effectively.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study focused on specific datasets, and there is a need for further exploration into datasets and evaluation methodologies.
- The evaluation metrics were designed specifically for the English language, and there is a need to adapt these metrics to other languages.
- The study acknowledges the potential biases in the LLMs used and the datasets employed during training. Further research is needed to address these biases.
