# Summary:

The study explores the use of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify users' internal emotion regulation strategies, a task that has not been previously addressed. The authors utilize the recently introduced Deep corpus, which includes recordings of human behavior in shame-inducing situations and self-reported information about individual experiences. The study presents the first cross-user evaluations on the Deep corpus and demonstrates that the LLM-based approach can reach an accuracy of 0.84 in emotion regulation classification without access to any information from informative but impractical post-interaction interviews.

## Major Findings:

1. The study utilizes LLMs instruction-tuned on prompts incorporating multimodal behavior to classify peoples' strategies to regulate the emotion shame.
2. In the first cross-user evaluations on the recently introduced Deep corpus, the approach outperforms the previous state of the art based on expert-constructed Bayesian Networks when information from post-interaction interviews is not available.
3. Extensive ablation experiments are conducted, highlighting the impact of different modalities on performance.

## Analysis and Critique:

The study presents a significant improvement over previous approaches based on Bayesian Networks and highlights the importance of modeling verbal behavior in emotion regulation. However, the study is limited by the size and variability of the Deep corpus, which is limited in size and variability due to the need for verbalized introspection and the complexity of the annotations. The ten participants were all having the same cultural background, similar age, and were pre-selected having good skills to reflect on their internal experiences. Therefore, the full range of emotion regulation strategies and associated nonverbal behavior may not be captured, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.

The study focuses on emotion regulation in validated shame-eliciting situations, limiting the extension of the work to situations where other emotion classes are elicited. Future work should extend the application of this proposed hybrid approach to other emotion classes, to gain an overall deeper understanding of individual emotional experiences.

Finally, while the proposed approach allows to automatically infer emotion regulation strategies from behavioral descriptions, the descriptions provided with the Deep dataset were manually annotated. Future work should replace such manual steps
