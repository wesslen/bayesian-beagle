# Summary:

**Summary:**
The paper proposes a multi-step diagnostic task and annotates a clinical diagnostic dataset (MSDiagnosis) that includes primary diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and final diagnosis questions. The authors also propose a novel and effective framework that combines forward inference, backward inference, reflection, and refinement, enabling the LLM to self-evaluate and adjust its diagnostic results. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

## Major Findings:
1. The paper introduces a multi-step diagnostic task and annotates a clinical diagnostic dataset (MSDiagnosis) that includes primary diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and final diagnosis questions.
2. The authors propose a novel and effective framework that combines forward inference, backward inference, reflection, and refinement, enabling the LLM to self-evaluate and adjust its diagnostic results.
3. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

## Analysis and Critique:
- The paper provides a comprehensive experimental analysis and suggests future research directions for this task.
- The proposed method could be further improved by incorporating more advanced techniques for forward inference, backward inference, reflection, and refinement.
- The proposed method could also be evaluated on other clinical diagnostic datasets to further validate its effectiveness.
- The paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed method, which could be a potential area for future research.
- The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other existing methods, which could be useful for understanding the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method.
