### Summary:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent developments in causal inference (CI) with latent variables. The authors start by discussing traditional CI techniques when variables of interest are assumed to be fully observed. They then provide an in-depth discussion of various CI strategies to handle latent variables, covering the tasks of causal effect estimation, mediation analysis, counterfactual reasoning, and causal discovery. The authors also generalize the discussion to graph data where interference among units may exist. Finally, they offer fresh aspects for further advancement of CI with latent variables, especially new opportunities in the era of large language models (LLMs).

### Major Findings:

1. The lack of observation of important variables (e.g., confounders, mediators, exogenous variables) severely compromises the reliability of CI methods.
2. Various consequences can be incurred if latent variables are carelessly handled, such as biased estimation of causal effects, incomplete understanding of causal mechanisms, and lack of individual-level causal consideration.
3. Circumvention-based methods eschew direct modeling of latent variables, while inference-based methods explicitly model the latent variables based on the observations.
4. The paper provides a novel taxonomy on existing CI methods to address latent variables, where two main categories of methods on four CI tasks are thoroughly discussed.
5. The paper offers insights into the future advancement of CI with latent variables, especially the new opportunities with large language models (LLM).

### Analysis and Critique:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent developments in CI with latent variables. The authors provide a clear and concise summary of the major findings in the field, as well as a novel taxonomy for categorizing existing CI methods. The paper also offers insights into the future advancement of CI with latent variables, particularly the potential of LLMs.

However, the paper does not provide a critical analysis of the limitations or shortcomings of the existing CI methods. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential biases or ethical considerations that may arise when using LLMs for CI. It would be beneficial for the authors to address these issues in future work.

Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution to the
