### Summary:
This paper investigates three low-resource cross-lingual approaches to enable an LLM to adapt to tasks in previously unseen languages. The authors focus on three Indic languages, Bengali, Hindi, and Tamil, as target languages and use Llama-2, an English-dominated LLM, for cross-lingual transfer. The study explores three approaches: adding additional supervisory signals via a dominant language, adapting target languages to word reordering, and continued pre-training in one low-resource language.

### Major Findings:
1. Adding additional supervisory signals via a dominant language in the LLM leads to improvements under in-context learning and fine-tuning.
2. Adapting target languages to word reordering may be beneficial under in-context learning, but its impact diminishes with fine-tuning.
3. Continued pre-training in one low-resource language can improve model performance for other related low-resource languages.

### Analysis and Critique:
The paper provides a comprehensive investigation of low-resource cross-lingual approaches for LLMs. However, the study is limited to three Indic languages and one LLM, Llama-2. The findings may not generalize to other languages or LLMs. Additionally, the study does not explore other potential approaches for cross-lingual transfer, such as using multilingual embeddings or transfer learning. The paper also does not discuss the computational cost of the proposed approaches, which could be a significant factor in their practical application.
