### Summary:

The paper introduces Agentless, an agentless approach to automatically solve software development problems. Unlike agent-based approaches, Agentless employs a simplistic two-phase process of localization followed by repair, without letting the LLM decide future actions or operate with complex tools. The authors evaluate Agentless on the popular SWE-bench Lite benchmark and demonstrate that it achieves the highest performance (27.33%) among all open-source approaches, at a fraction of the cost.

### Major Findings:

1. Agentless is an agentless approach that outperforms existing open-source software agents in terms of performance (27.33%) and cost ($0.34) on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark.
2. The authors manually classified the problems in SWE-bench Lite and found issues with exact ground truth patch or insufficient/misleading issue descriptions.
3. The authors constructed SWE-bench Lite- by excluding problematic issues to perform more rigorous evaluation and comparison.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents an interesting and novel approach to solving software development problems using an agentless approach. The results are promising, as Agentless outperforms existing open-source software agents in terms of performance and cost. However, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other agent-based approaches, which could be a limitation. Additionally, the authors do not discuss potential biases or limitations in their manual classification of the problems in SWE-bench Lite. Overall, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of software engineering and highlights the potential of a simple, interpretable technique in autonomous software development.
