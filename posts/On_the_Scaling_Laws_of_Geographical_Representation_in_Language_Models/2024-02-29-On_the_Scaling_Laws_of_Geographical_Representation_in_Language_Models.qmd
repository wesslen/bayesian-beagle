### Summary:

- The paper investigates how geographical knowledge is embedded and scales in language models.
- Geographical information can be extracted from models as small as 14M parameters, and the performance increases with model size.
- Larger models are more geographically biased than smaller ones, and this bias is correlated with the frequency of country names in the training data.

### Major Findings:

1. **Geographical information in small models:** Geographical information can be extracted from models with as few as 14M parameters, indicating that this capability is present even in tiny models.
2. **Performance increases with model size:** The performance of probes in extracting geographical information seems to increase with model size, suggesting that larger models have a better capacity to embed geographical knowledge.
3. **Geographical bias in larger models:** Larger models are more geographically biased than smaller ones, and this bias is correlated with the frequency of country names in the training data, indicating that the bias is inherited from the data used for training.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The paper focuses on analyzing the geographical knowledge embedded in language models, but it could benefit from a more in-depth discussion on the potential consequences and implications of this bias in real-world applications.
- The authors mention that the better performance of larger models is not solely related to the ability of probes to extract better patterns from higher-dimensionality hidden representations, but it would be helpful to provide more evidence or experimental results to support this claim.
- The paper could also discuss potential methods or techniques to mitigate the observed geographical bias in language models, providing insights for future research in this area.
