# Summary

The paper introduces a novel approach to video quality assessment (VQA) using large multimodal models (LMMs), called LMM-VQA. The proposed method reformulates the quality regression problem into a question-and-answering (Q&A) task and constructs Q&A prompts for VQA instruction tuning. LMM-VQA employs a spatiotemporal vision encoder to extract spatial and temporal features, which are then mapped into the language space for modality alignment. The aligned visual tokens and quality-inquired text tokens are aggregated as inputs for the large language model (LLM) to generate the quality score and level.

## Major Findings

1. LMM-VQA achieves state-of-the-art performance across five VQA benchmarks, demonstrating an average improvement of  in generalization ability over existing methods.
2. The advanced design of the spatiotemporal encoder and projector enables LMM-VQA to perform exceptionally well on general video understanding tasks.
3. The code for LMM-VQA will be made available at <https://github.com/Sueqk/LMM-VQA>.

## Analysis and Critique

1. The paper presents a promising approach to VQA using LMMs, which has the potential to improve the performance and generalization ability of VQA models.
2. The use of a spatiotemporal vision encoder and modality alignment is a novel approach to addressing the challenges of VQA, which could inspire further research in this area.
3. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of LMM-VQA with other state-of-the-art VQA methods, which could help to better understand its strengths and limitations.
4. The paper does not discuss the computational complexity and efficiency of LMM-VQA, which are important considerations for practical applications.
5. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations and potential biases of LMM-VQA, which could help to identify areas for improvement and further research.
