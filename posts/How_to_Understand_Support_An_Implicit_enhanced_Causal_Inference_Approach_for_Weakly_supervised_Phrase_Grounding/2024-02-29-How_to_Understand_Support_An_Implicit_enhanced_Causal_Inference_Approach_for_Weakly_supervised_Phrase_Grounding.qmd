### Summary

- Weakly-supervised Phrase Grounding (WPG) is an emerging task in multimodal learning that involves inferring fine-grained phrase-region matching using coarse-grained sentence-image pairs for training.
- Existing studies on WPG often overlook implicit phrase-region matching relations, which are crucial for evaluating a model's ability to understand deep multimodal semantics.
- This paper proposes an Implicit-Enhanced Causal Inference (IECI) approach that uses intervention and counterfactual techniques to address the challenges of modeling implicit relations and highlighting them beyond the explicit.
- A high-quality implicit-enhanced dataset is annotated to evaluate IECI, and results show its advantages over state-of-the-art baselines.

### Major Findings

1. **Implicit Relations in WPG:** The paper highlights the importance
