### Summary:

The study introduces Multilingual Blending, a mixed-language query-response scheme designed to evaluate the safety alignment of various state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, Llama3) under sophisticated, multilingual conditions. The researchers investigate language patterns such as language availability, morphology, and language family that could impact the effectiveness of Multilingual Blending in compromising the safeguards of LLMs. The experimental results show that, without meticulously crafted prompt templates, Multilingual Blending significantly amplifies the detriment of malicious queries, leading to dramatically increased bypass rates in LLM safety alignment ( on GPT-3.5 and  on GPT-4o), far exceeding those of single-language baselines. Moreover, the performance of Multilingual Blending varies notably based on intrinsic linguistic properties, with languages of different morphology and from diverse families being more prone to evading safety alignments. These findings underscore the necessity of evaluating LLMs and developing corresponding safety alignment strategies in a complex, multilingual context to align with their superior cross-language generalization capabilities.

### Major Findings:

1. Multilingual Blending, a mixed-language query-response scheme, is introduced to evaluate the safety alignment of various state-of-the-art LLMs under sophisticated, multilingual conditions.
2. The experimental results show that Multilingual Blending significantly amplifies the detriment of malicious queries, leading to dramatically increased bypass rates in LLM safety alignment ( on GPT-3.5 and  on GPT-4o), far exceeding those of single-language baselines.
3. The performance of Multilingual Blending varies notably based on intrinsic linguistic properties, with languages of different morphology and from diverse families being more prone to evading safety alignments.

### Analysis and Critique:

The study provides valuable insights into the evaluation of LLMs' safety alignment in a complex, multilingual context. However, there are some potential limitations and areas for further research:

1. The study focuses on a limited number of state-of-the-art LLMs, and it would be beneficial to expand the evaluation to a broader range of
