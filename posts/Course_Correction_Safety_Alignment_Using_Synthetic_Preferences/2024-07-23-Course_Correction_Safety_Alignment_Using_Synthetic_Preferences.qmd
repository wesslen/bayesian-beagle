### Summary:

The paper presents a systematic study on assessing and improving the capability of large language models (LLMs) to perform course-correction, i.e., autonomously steering away from generating harmful content. The authors introduce the C2-Eval benchmark for quantitative assessment and analyze 10 popular LLMs, revealing varying proficiency in course-correction. To improve, they propose fine-tuning LLMs with preference learning, emphasizing the preference for timely course-correction. Using an automated pipeline, they create C2-Syn, a synthetic dataset with 750K pairwise preferences, to teach models the concept of timely course-correction through data-driven preference learning. Experiments on Llama2-Chat 7B and Qwen2 7B show that their method effectively enhances course-correction skills without affecting general performance and improves LLMs' safety, particularly in resisting jailbreak attacks.

### Major Findings:

1. The C2-Eval benchmark and systematic investigation of 10 popular LLMs' ability on course-correction quantitatively.
2. A fully automated pipeline to collect preference data and contribute to C2-Syn that can be leveraged to teach models the nuances of course-correction from data patterns.
3. Based on Llama2-Chat 7B and Qwen2 7B, experiments show that preference learning can teach LLMs to course-correct without harming helpfulness.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper does not provide a clear definition of "harmful content" and "safety," which could lead to subjective interpretations.
2. The authors do not discuss the potential limitations of using synthetic data for preference learning, such as the risk of overfitting or the lack of real-world context.
3. The paper does not address the potential ethical implications of teaching LLMs to course-correct, such as the risk of suppressing diverse viewpoints or perpetuating biases.
4. The authors do not provide a comprehensive comparison of their method with other existing approaches to improving LLMs' safety, such as red-teaming or adversarial training.
5. The paper does not discuss the potential scalability issues of their method, such as the computational resources required to generate
