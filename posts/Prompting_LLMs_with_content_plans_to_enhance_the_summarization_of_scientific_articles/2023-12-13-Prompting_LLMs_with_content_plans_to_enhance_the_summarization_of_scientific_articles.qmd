# Prompting LLMs with Content Plans to Enhance the Summarization of Scientific Articles

## Key Findings
- The study introduces novel **prompting techniques** to improve the performance of **automatic summarization systems** for **scientific articles**, demonstrating consistent performance improvements from prompting techniques on smaller models
- Results show that **smaller models** obtain **ROUGE-1 score increases** around 0.1-0.4 when summarizing sections aided by prompts, indicating the effectiveness of prompting to overcome the limitations of smaller, less capable summarization systems
- The study suggests that rather than large models, **lightweight models supplemented with prompts** may be preferable in resource-constrained contexts like mobile devices.

## Abstract
The paper presents novel prompting techniques to enhance automatic summarization systems for scientific articles, addressing the challenges posed by the length and complexity of these documents. The study tests the techniques with various summarization models and input texts, showing consistent performance gains, especially for smaller models summarizing sections separately.

## Introduction
- **Automatic text summarization** aims to produce shortened versions of documents while retaining relevant information, with current systems based on abstractive summarization models, such as transformer architectures.
- Summarizing scientific articles is particularly challenging due to their length, linguistic complexity, and irregular organizational structures.
- The study introduces novel prompting techniques to provide *key term context* and enhance scientific literature summarizers, aiming to address the limitations of less powerful systems.

## Related Work
- Conventional approaches to automatic summarization heavily relied on **extractive methods** but current dominant paradigm has shifted toward **abstractive methods** using neural network architectures.
- The study contextualizes the work by summarizing prior studies and techniques in automatic text summarization, particularly focusing on prompting and section-level summarization.

## Methods
- The study details three key evaluation dimensions: **prompting technique dimension**, **model dimension**, and **input text dimension**.
- Different approaches for generating prompts are compared, various state-of-the-art transformer models are evaluated, and three main text input conditions are studied.

## Results
- Experiment results demonstrate consistent performance improvements from prompting techniques on smaller summarization models. The study also highlights the benefits of prompting based on the attention mechanism and the input text dimension.

## Discussion
- The findings reveal that smaller models demonstrate significant performance improvements when subjected to prompting techniques, particularly for section-level summarization.
- The study discusses the implications of the results, highlighting the potential of prompting as a technique for enhancing small neural network summarizers and its practical applications.

## Future Work
- The study outlines future research opportunities, including exploring new prompting techniques, investigating automated prompt generation, and adapting attention mechanisms.
- High-level directions for future work are suggested based on the observations and implications of the study.

## Conclusion
- The paper introduces and evaluates **prompting techniques** as an effective approach to enhancing scientific summarization systems, particularly for smaller models and section-level summarization.
- The study provides valuable insights into the potential of prompting and suggests promising opportunities for future research. It also acknowledges the support received for the work.
