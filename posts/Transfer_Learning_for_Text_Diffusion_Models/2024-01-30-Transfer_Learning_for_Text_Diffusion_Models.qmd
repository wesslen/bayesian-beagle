### **Summary:**
The article explores the potential for text diffusion to replace autoregressive (AR) decoding for the training and deployment of large language models (LLMs). The authors establish a strong baseline setup for training text diffusion models and test various transfer learning setups for text diffusion models. They find that text diffusion underperforms the standard AR approach on machine translation but outperforms AR models in code synthesis and extractive QA tasks. The authors also observe quality gains from adapting AR models to use diffusion decoding.

### Major Findings:
1. Training a decoder-only model with a prefix LM objective is best or near-best across several tasks.
2. Text diffusion models trained from scratch outperform AR models in many cases, especially in code synthesis and extractive QA tasks.
3. Adapting AR models to use diffusion decoding results in quality gains, showing promise for text diffusion models.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the potential of text diffusion models to replace autoregressive decoding for large language models. However, the findings are not consistent across all tasks, as text diffusion underperforms in machine translation. Additionally, the article does not thoroughly explore the potential limitations and challenges of using text diffusion models. Further research is needed to address the inconsistencies in performance across different tasks and to identify the specific conditions under which text diffusion models outperform AR models. Additionally, the article could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the practical implications and applications of text diffusion models in real-world scenarios.
