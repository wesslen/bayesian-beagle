### Summary:

The paper introduces a training-free algorithm to address the issue of "text inertia" in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where the models generate consistent descriptions with or without visual input. The proposed method, Paying Attention to Image (PAI), adaptively adjusts and amplifies the attention weights assigned to image tokens, granting greater prominence to visual elements. It also subtracts the logits of multi-modal inputs from ones of pure text input to prevent LVLMs from being biased towards Large Language Models (LLMs). The method substantially reduces the frequency of hallucinatory outputs in various LVLMs, as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

### Major Findings:

1. The proposed PAI method effectively mitigates the text inertia problem and yields accurate descriptions, as opposed to the hallucinated descriptions generated by LVLMs without the method.
2. The PAI method enhances image tokens and reduces the stubborn output of LLMs, allowing LVLMs to pay more attention to images and alleviate text inertia, thereby reducing hallucination in LVLMs.
3. The method is training-free and does not require additional training or external tools, unlike previous methods for mitigating hallucination.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper provides a novel approach to addressing the issue of hallucination in LVLMs, which is a significant problem in the field.
2. The proposed method is training-free, which is a major advantage as it does not require additional resources or time for training.
3. The method is evaluated on various LVLMs and is shown to substantially reduce the frequency of hallucinatory outputs, demonstrating its effectiveness.
4. However, the paper does not discuss any potential limitations or shortcomings of the proposed method, which would be useful for future research.
5. The paper also does not provide a comparison with other existing methods for mitigating hallucination in LVLMs, which would be helpful for understanding the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method.
6. The paper could also benefit from a more detailed explanation of the method and its implementation, as well as a more thorough analysis of the results.
