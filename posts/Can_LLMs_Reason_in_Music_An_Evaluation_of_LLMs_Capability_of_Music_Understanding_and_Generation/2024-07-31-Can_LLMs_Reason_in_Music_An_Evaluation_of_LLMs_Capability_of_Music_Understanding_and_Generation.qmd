### Summary:

- The study evaluates the performance of large language models (LLMs) in symbolic music understanding and generation, focusing on their multi-step reasoning capabilities.
- Four LLMs—GPT-4, Gemma-7B-it, Llama2-7B-chat, and Qwen-7B-chat—are assessed on various symbolic music tasks, including music theory exercises, motif extraction, musical form extraction, chord-conditioned music generation, melody harmonization, and musical-form-and-motif-conditioned music generation.
- The study finds that current LLMs exhibit poor performance in song-level multi-step music reasoning and typically fail to leverage learned music knowledge when addressing complex musical tasks.
- The main contributions of the paper include multi-step prompt engineering, assessing four major LLMs on various symbolic music tasks, and analyzing their reasoning in ABC sequences through quantitative statistical results and qualitative human assessment, including error analysis.

### Major Findings:

1. Current LLMs exhibit poor performance in song-level multi-step music reasoning and typically fail to leverage learned music knowledge when addressing complex musical tasks.
2. The study provides multi-step prompt engineering to explore how LLMs exhibit their reasoning capabilities with multi-step instructions in music understanding and generation tasks.
3. The paper assesses four major LLMs on various symbolic music tasks, analyzing their reasoning in ABC sequences through quantitative statistical results and qualitative human assessment, including error analysis.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The study highlights the limitations of current LLMs in the realm of music understanding and generation, particularly from the perspective of song-level multi-step reasoning.
- The findings suggest that achieving advanced musical capability is not intrinsically obtained by LLMs, and future research should focus more on bridging the gap between music knowledge and reasoning to improve the co-creation experience for musicians.
- The study emphasizes the need for more step-by-step learning strategies specifically developed for instruction-based symbolic music tasks, focusing on correctly answering music theory exercises, explicitly extracting motifs, and consistently following the conditions in the instructions.
- The paper acknowledges the limitations of the widely-used CoT and ICL approaches in improving the model's performance and suggests the implementation of a knowledge
