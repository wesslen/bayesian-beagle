### Summary:
Direct Language Model Alignment from Online AI Feedback is a study that introduces a method called Online AI Feedback (OAIF) to improve Direct Alignment from Preferences (DAP) methods. The study compares OAIF with offline DAP and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods and demonstrates its effectiveness through human and AI evaluation. The study also explores the controllability of the LLM annotator and the impact of the size of the LLM annotator on performance.

### Major Findings:
1. OAIF outperforms both offline DAP and RLHF methods in several tasks, as demonstrated through human evaluation.
2. The feedback leveraged in OAIF is easily controllable, as shown by injecting specific instructions into the prompts to control response length.
3. The size of the LLM annotator has a significant impact on the performance of OAIF, with larger annotators leading to better performance.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study provides a comprehensive comparison of OAIF with existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. However, the limitations of the study include the lack of evaluation on out-of-distribution prompts and the need for further investigation into the impact of scaling up the aligned models.
- The method proposed in the study offers a promising solution for aligning LLMs with human values, with potential applications in scalable alignment strategies. However, the study should be considered within the larger context of responsible and safe AI, as it relies on AI feedback.
