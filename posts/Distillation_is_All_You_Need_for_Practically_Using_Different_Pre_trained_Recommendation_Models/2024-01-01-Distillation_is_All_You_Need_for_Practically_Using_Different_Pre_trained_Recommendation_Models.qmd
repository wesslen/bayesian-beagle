### Main Findings
1. **PRM-KD** is proposed as a method for **knowledge distillation** from different **pre-trained recommendation models (PRMs)** to enhance student recommendation models in practical recommender systems.
2. PRM-KD achieves consistent improvements over competitive baselines on five real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness, universality, and efficiency of the model.
3. The proposed PRM-KD provides a good trade-off between performance, inference speed, and memory cost, significantly outperforming the PRMs and not increasing online memory and computational costs.

### Methodology
- **Distillation from Different PRM Teachers**
  - Introduction to different types of PRMs
  - The need to adopt different PRMs as teacher models
