2. **Exploiting Large Language Models for Clinical Reasoning**: The study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) in clinical reasoning for disease diagnosis through experiments and analyses on both rationale generation and disease diagnosis in various settings.
3. **Evaluation of Machine-Generated Rationales**: The paper proposes a novel set of criteria specifically designed to evaluate machine-generated rationales for clinical diagnosis, facilitating future research in this area.

### Abstract
The study presents a "reasoning-aware" diagnosis framework that rationalizes the diagnostic process via prompt-based learning and explores the clinical reasoning for disease diagnosis using large language models (LLMs), demonstrating the ability of LLMs/LMs' clinical reasoning through extensive experiments and analyses on rationale generation and disease diagnosis. Furthermore, the paper proposes a novel set of criteria for evaluating machine-generated rationales' potential for real-world clinical settings, benefiting future research in this area.

### Introduction
- **Importance of Clinical Reasoning**: Effective clinical reasoning is crucial for diagnosis in real clinical settings, and poor clinical reasoning has been linked to misdiagnoses and adverse events.
- **Shortcomings of Existing Approaches**: The predominant portion of existing approaches for disease diagnosis neglects clinical reasoning and focuses on image or text classification, which can be limited by the data-scarcity problem in biomedical domains.
- **Potential of Large Language Models**: Large language models have demonstrated the ability to perform multi-step reasoning and present the thinking process behind it in various domains.

### Problem Formulation
- **Clinical Reasoning for Disease Diagnosis**: The paper addresses the absence of effective clinical reasoning in disease diagnosis and explores the use of LLMs' reasoning capacity in clinical diagnosis to improve diagnostic accuracy and reliability.

### Testbed: Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis
- **Significance of Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis**: The study uses the Alzheimer’s Disease diagnosis task as the testbed for clinical reasoning, explicating the importance of understanding various aspects of the disease and the components of patient descriptions for diagnosis.

### Reasoning-Aware Diagnosis Framework
- **Framework Overview**: The paper proposes a reasoning-aware diagnosis framework, involving modules addressing different approaches to facilitate clinical reasoning, such as clinical rationalization, few-shot CoT reasoning, and knowledge distillation.
- **Implementation Details of Student Models**: The study provides implementation details for the experiments conducted on student models, discussing the experimental settings, datasets used, and the LLMs adopted.

### Experiments
- **Experimental Settings**: The study provides details on the datasets (ADNI and AIBL) used, the transformation of MRIs into textual descriptions, and the statistics of the collected data.
- **Performance, Knowledge Distillation, and Data Efficiency**: The paper presents the empirical findings of the research questions guiding the experiments (RQ1, RQ2, RQ3, RQ4), showcasing the impact of clinical rationales on AD diagnosis and the benefits of knowledge distillation and data efficiency in clinical diagnostic reasoning.
- **Quality of Machine-Generated Rationales**: The study conducted human evaluations and analysis of the quality of machine-generated clinical rationales, demonstrating the effective replication of clinical reasoning of radiologists and the clinical potential of the rationales for real-world applications.

### Related Work
- **Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis, Clinical NLP**: The paper discusses the limitations of existing methods for AD diagnosis and the prior work on DL-based methods for AD diagnosis, clinical NLP, and LLMs in biomedical fields, laying the groundwork for the need and significance of the proposed reasoning-aware diagnosis framework.

### Conclusion and Appendix
- **Conclusion and Limitations**: The study concludes by highlighting the limitations of the research and the need for societal impact assessment, and acknowledges the support received for the study.
- **Appendix**: Appendices A, B, and C provide additional details on the datasets used, prompts for rationale generation and diagnosis, and the implementation details of student models used in the experiments.

### Critique
The paper presents a comprehensive and detailed framework for reasoning-aware diagnosis, addressing the limitations of existing approaches and demonstrating the potential of LLMs in clinical reasoning. However, the study could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential biases in the datasets used, and the limitations of the proposed framework in real-world clinical settings. Additionally, further exploration of alternative paradigms for reasoning-aware diagnosis beyond autoregressive generation and data efficiency explanations in the experimental results would enhance the paper's impact.
