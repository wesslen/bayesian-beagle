### **Summary:**
- The article introduces AVI-Talking, an Audio-Visual Instruction system for expressive 3D Talking face generation.
- The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to instruct the realistic synthesis of 3D talking faces.
- It involves a two-stage process, with the first stage comprehending audio information and generating instructions, and the second stage executing these instructions using a diffusion-based generative network.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The system introduces AVI-Talking, an innovative audio-visual instruction system that directly leverages the inherent style information conveyed by human speech for expressive talking face generation.
2. Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated as an audio-visual instruction agent to comprehend the speakerâ€™s talking status and generate talking face instructions.
3. A language-guided talking face synthesis network with disentangled speech content and content irrelevant space is designed to execute visual instruction effectively.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The article presents a comprehensive and innovative approach to audio-visual instruction for expressive 3D talking face generation.
- The system demonstrates strong performance in generating vivid 3D talking faces with expressive facial details and consistent emotional status.
- However, the model exhibits insensitivity to certain specific speaking statuses, possibly due to uneven data distribution in the training dataset.
- The capabilities of the talking face synthesis network are limited to handling visual instructions closely aligned with the overall dataset distributions, which may require users to provide specific instructions for optimal performance.

Overall, the article provides a strong foundation for future research in the field of expressive 3D talking face generation, with potential areas for improvement in addressing data distribution and generalizing the capabilities of the talking face synthesis network.
