**Summary:**

The paper presents a prompt learning framework-based method for legal charge prediction that leverages multi-source heterogeneous external knowledge from a legal knowledge base, a conversational LLM, and related legal articles. The method matches knowledge snippets in case descriptions via the legal knowledge base and encapsulates them into the input through a hard prompt template. It also retrieves legal articles related to a given case description through contrastive learning and obtains factual elements within the case description through a conversational LLM. The method fuses the embedding vectors of soft prompt tokens with the encoding vector of factual elements to achieve knowledge-enhanced model forward inference. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results on CAIL-2018, the largest legal charge prediction dataset, and has lower data dependency.

**Major Findings:**

1. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results on CAIL-2018, the largest legal charge prediction dataset, with a macro F1 score of 0.84.
2. The method has lower data dependency, as its performance remains high even with a reduced training data size.
3. The method demonstrates strong interpretability, as shown in case studies.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper presents a novel approach to legal charge prediction that leverages multi-source heterogeneous external knowledge. The method's ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on the largest legal charge prediction dataset and its lower data dependency are significant contributions. However, the paper does not explore situations where a single case description may correspond to multiple legal charges, which could be a limitation. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other methods that also use external knowledge, such as knowledge graphs or ontologies. The paper could also benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the interpretability of the method, as this is a crucial aspect in the legal domain.
