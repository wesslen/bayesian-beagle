## Summary

**Major Findings:**
1. Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for various natural language processing tasks due to their capabilities in text generation, coding, and knowledge reasoning.
2. Concerns about the safety and security of LLM systems have been identified, including privacy leakage, toxicity and bias tendencies, hallucinations, and vulnerability to model attacks.
3. The paper proposes a comprehensive risk taxonomy for LLM systems, categorizing risks and their mitigation strategies across input, language model, toolchain, and output modules.

**Sections:**
- **I Introduction**: Introduces the significance of LLMs and the concerns about their safety and security.
- **II Background**: Discusses the characteristics of LLMs, including their architecture, training pipeline, and the scaling law.
- **III Modules of LLM Systems**: Identifies the key modules of an LLM system, such as the input, language model, toolchain, and output modules, and highlights the potential risks associated with each module.
- **IV Risks in LLM Systems**: Categorizes risks across various modules of an LLM system, including risks in input modules, language models, toolchain modules, and output modules. It also discusses the specific risks and sub-categorized risk topics within each module.
- **V Mitigation**: Provides a survey of mitigation strategies for each identified risk, covering defensive prompt design, adversarial prompt detection, adjusting the order of pre-defined prompts, changing input format, and more.

**Critique/Issues:**
The paper provides a detailed taxonomy and mitigation strategies for risks associated with LLM systems. However, it lacks empirical evidence or case studies to support the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies. Additionally, the complexity of the proposed taxonomy may pose challenges for practical implementation. The paper could benefit from real-world examples or experimental results to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed strategies.
