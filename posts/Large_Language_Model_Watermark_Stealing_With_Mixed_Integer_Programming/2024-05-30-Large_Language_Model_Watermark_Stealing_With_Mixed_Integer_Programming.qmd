The paper presents a novel watermark removal attack against the state-of-the-art LLM watermark scheme, using mixed-integer programming to extract the feasible green list. The attack can successfully steal the green list and remove the watermark, even without any prior knowledge, access to the watermark detector API, or information about the LLMs' parameter settings or watermark injection/detection scheme. The proposed method forms a generic framework capable of targeting both single-key and multi-key watermark schemes, including token-level and sentence-level approaches. The paper highlights the urgent need for dedicated defenses against watermark removal attacks and suggests possible directions for future research.

The paper is structured as follows:

1. Introduction: The introduction provides a brief overview of the problem of watermarking in LLMs and the need for a systematic watermark removal method.
2. Background and Related Work: This section provides a brief overview of the existing work on LLM watermarking and watermark removal.
3. Threat Model: This section describes the threat model used in the paper, including the attacker's capabilities and knowledge.
4. Green List Stealing: This section describes the proposed method for stealing the green list, using mixed-integer programming to extract the feasible green list.
5. Watermark Removal: This section describes the proposed method for removing the watermark, using the stolen green list to replace the green tokens with red tokens.
6. Experimental Evaluation: This section presents the experimental evaluation of the proposed method, including the experimental setup, datasets, and results.
7. Discussion: This section discusses the implications of the proposed method and its limitations.
8. Conclusion: The conclusion summarizes the main contributions of the paper and suggests directions for future research.

The paper is well-structured and provides a clear and concise summary of the proposed method and its experimental evaluation. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of the related work and a detailed description of the threat model. The experimental evaluation is well-designed and provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed method. The paper also provides a discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and suggests directions for future research.

Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a valuable contribution to the field of LLM watermarking and watermark removal. The proposed method is a significant step forward
