### Summary:
The article discusses the need for decentralization in the education system, as the current centralized approach renders students' credentials dependent on expensive, prestigious institutions. The authors propose integrating Decentralized Identity (DID) with Web 3.0 to upload credentials directly linked to the user, appended to an Ethereum blockchain. This approach aims to eliminate discrepancies and provide a secure connection to the internet for non-fungibility of credentials and user authentication.

### Major Findings:
1. **Decentralized Approach to Education:** The centralized nature of education places students in underprivileged communities at a disadvantage, and a decentralized approach would eliminate such discrepancies.
2. **Decentralized Identity (DID):** DID is a form of authentication standardized by Web 3.0 that does not require a major entity to validate the user, providing ownership of the user's access and possession of online data.
3. **Ownership of Learning:** The article discusses the validity and trust issues associated with the current education system, highlighting the challenges in verifying skills and the need for a decentralized approach.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article effectively highlights the need for decentralization in the education system and proposes a viable solution using Web 3.0 and Decentralized Identity. However, the article could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the potential challenges and limitations of implementing this decentralized approach. Additionally, further research is needed to address the practical implications and scalability of integrating DID with Web 3.0 in the education sector. The article could also explore the potential impact on traditional educational institutions and the broader implications for the future of education.
