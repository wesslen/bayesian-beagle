### Summary:

- The paper introduces a new approach for making direct alignment length-invariant in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs).
- The proposed method involves introducing a new averaging operator for policies and composing it with the operator providing the optimal RL solution.
- The authors empirically study the effect of such averaging, observing a trade-off between the length of generations and their scores.

### Major Findings:

1. The authors propose a principled approach for making direct alignment length-invariant by introducing a new averaging operator for policies and composing it with the operator providing the optimal RL solution.
2. The proposed method is applied to direct alignment, which translates into replacing log-likelihoods by length-normalized log-likelihoods in the underlying loss function.
3. The authors empirically study the effect of such averaging and observe a trade-off between the length of generations and their scores.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The paper presents a novel approach to address the issue of length-invariance in direct alignment methods for LLMs.
- The proposed method is mathematically principled and provides a practical algorithm for direct alignment methods.
- The authors empirically study the effect of such averaging and observe a trade-off between the length of generations and their scores. However, the paper does not provide a clear explanation for this trade-off or its implications for the performance of LLMs.
- The paper does not discuss the potential limitations or drawbacks of the proposed method, such as its computational complexity or its impact on the convergence of the optimization process.
- The paper does not compare the proposed method to other existing approaches for making direct alignment length-invariant, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its performance.
- The paper does not provide a clear motivation for the need for length-invariance in direct alignment methods, which could help to better understand the significance of the proposed approach.
