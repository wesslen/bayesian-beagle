### Summary:
- The authors propose the LeRuD approach to address the challenges of reasoning over complex propagation information on social media, using prompts to teach LLMs to concentrate on important clues in news and comments, and dividing the propagation information into a Chain-of-Propagation to reduce the burden on LLMs. 
- Extensive experiments on Twitter and Weibo datasets show that LeRuD outperforms several state-of-the-art rumor detection models by 2.4% to 7.6% and demonstrates promising rumor detection ability in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios.
- LeRuD uses reasoning from a commonsense perspective to judge the credibility of news samples, considering factors such as the regularity of writing, adequacy of details, plausibility of contents, attitudes of the public, and consistency of comments to make its judgments.

### Major Findings:
1. LeRuD outperforms several state-of-the-art rumor detection models by 2.4% to 7.6%.
2. LeRuD demonstrates promising rumor detection ability in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios.
3. LeRuD uses reasoning from a commonsense perspective to judge the credibility of news samples, considering various factors to make its judgments.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The LeRuD approach addresses the limitations of LLMs in reasoning over excessive information and presents a novel solution to improve their performance in detecting rumors on social media platforms.
- The use of AI to assess the credibility of news based on user comments on social media platforms has implications for combating misinformation and fake news by leveraging AI technology to gauge public trust and skepticism.
- The analysis of news articles and comments highlights the importance of considering writing style, specific details, and the presence of conflicting opinions in the comments to determine the credibility of news sources. This process demonstrates the significance of critical evaluation in assessing the authenticity of news.
