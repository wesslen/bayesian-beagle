### Summary:

The paper introduces EAGLE, a novel two-stage end-to-end visual enhancement framework designed to improve the geometric reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The framework aims to address the limitations of existing MLLMs, which struggle with inaccurate geometric perception and hallucinations. EAGLE consists of two stages: preliminary visual enhancement with a frozen LLM and advanced visual enhancement with a dynamic LLM. In the first stage, the model is trained with geometric image-caption pairs to endow it with basic geometric knowledge. In the second stage, LoRA modules are incorporated into the vision encoder, and the LLM backbone is unfreezed to enable the model to leverage the inherent chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales within question-answer pairs. This allows the model to focus on nuanced visual cues and enhance its overall perceptual capacity. The paper presents extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on popular benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.

### Major Findings:

1. Existing MLLMs suffer from inaccurate geometric perception and hallucinations, which hinder their performance in solving geometric problems.
2. EAGLE, a novel two-stage end-to-end visual enhancement framework, is proposed to improve the geometric reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
3. The first stage of EAGLE involves preliminary visual enhancement with a frozen LLM, while the second stage involves advanced visual enhancement with a dynamic LLM.
4. EAGLE outperforms existing MLLMs on popular benchmarks, such as GeoQA and MathVista, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving geometric problems.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a well-structured and coherent summary of the proposed EAGLE framework. The authors provide a clear motivation for the research, highlighting the limitations of existing MLLMs in solving geometric problems. The proposed framework, EAGLE, is a novel approach that aims to improve the geometric reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. The two-stage visual enhancement process, which involves preliminary and advanced visual enhancement, is well-explained and supported by experimental results.

However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed framework. For instance
