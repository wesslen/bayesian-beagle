### Summary:

The paper presents a conceptual framework that combines modeling event logs, intelligent modeling assistants (IMAs), and the generation of modeling operations using large language models (LLMs). The proposed framework aims to address the challenge of producing accurate software models in model-driven software engineering (MDE), which is an error-prone task that requires deep application domain knowledge. The framework leverages the in-context learning approach to generate modeling operations using LLMs, which can be used to train IMAs. The proposed framework is evaluated using a set of existing modeling tools employed in industrial use cases within different European projects. The evaluation focuses on assessing the capability of LLMs to generate realistic modeling operations and the recommended operations' performance using real-world industrial modeling artifacts. The findings demonstrate that LLMs can generate modeling events, although the overall accuracy is higher when considering human-based operations. The proposed framework can be an alternative when modeling operations are not available to train traditional IMAs specifically conceived to support industrial practitioners.

### Major Findings:

1. The proposed framework combines modeling event logs, intelligent modeling assistants (IMAs), and the generation of modeling operations using large language models (LLMs) to address the challenge of producing accurate software models in MDE.
2. The framework leverages the in-context learning approach to generate modeling operations using LLMs, which can be used to train IMAs.
3. The proposed framework is evaluated using a set of existing modeling tools employed in industrial use cases within different European projects.
4. The evaluation focuses on assessing the capability of LLMs to generate realistic modeling operations and the recommended operations' performance using real-world industrial modeling artifacts.
5. The findings demonstrate that LLMs can generate modeling events, although the overall accuracy is higher when considering human-based operations.
6. The proposed framework can be an alternative when modeling operations are not available to train traditional IMAs specifically conceived to support industrial practitioners.

### Analysis and Critique:

The proposed framework presents a promising approach to address the challenge of producing accurate software models in MDE. The use of LLMs to generate modeling operations can be a valuable alternative when training data are not available due to different factors, such as internal regulations or privacy issues. However, the evaluation of the proposed framework is limited to a set of existing modeling tools employed in industrial
