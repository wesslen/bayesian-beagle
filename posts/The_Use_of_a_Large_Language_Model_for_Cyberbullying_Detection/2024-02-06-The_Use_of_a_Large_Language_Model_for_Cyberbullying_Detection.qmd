### **Summary:**
- Cyberbullying is a prevalent issue in today's digital world, posing a threat to the mental and physical health of individuals.
- Large language models (LLMs) like BERT and RoBERTa have shown potential for cyberbullying detection, but their application in this context is limited.
- The study aimed to explore the use of LLMs for cyberbullying detection and prepared a new dataset for algorithm development.

### **Major Findings:**
1. **Dominance of Social Media in Cyberbullying:** The emergence of social technologies has increased the channels of cyberbullying, impacting a significant portion of the population.
2. **Performance of Large Language Models:** Experimental results showed that RoBERTa outperformed other models for cyberbullying detection, indicating the potential of LLMs in this context.
3. **Dataset Preparation and Comparison:** The study prepared a new dataset and compared the performance of traditional machine learning models with LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of RoBERTa.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- **Limitations of Traditional Models:** Traditional machine learning models struggled with the imbalanced dataset, highlighting the need for more advanced approaches like LLMs.
- **Consistent Performance of RoBERTa:** The study consistently found that RoBERTa performed well in both balanced and imbalanced datasets, indicating its potential as a state-of-the-art model for cyberbullying detection.
- **Future Research Directions:** The study suggested extending the implementation to other languages and exploring multimodal approaches for cyberbullying detection.

The study provides valuable insights into the potential of large language models for cyberbullying detection and highlights the need for more sophisticated approaches to address this prevalent issue. The consistent performance of RoBERTa across different datasets underscores its significance as a powerful tool in combating cyberbullying. However, the study also emphasizes the importance of further research to expand the application of these models to other languages and forms of online abuse.
