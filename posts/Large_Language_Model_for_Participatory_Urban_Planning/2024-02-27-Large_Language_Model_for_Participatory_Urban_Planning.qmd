### Summary:
- Participatory urban planning is a mainstream approach that involves the active engagement of residents, but it is often time-consuming and costly.
- Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown considerable ability to simulate human-like agents, which can be used to emulate the participatory process easily.
- The authors introduce an LLM-based multi-agent collaboration framework for participatory urban planning, which can generate land-use plans for urban regions considering the diverse needs of residents.

### Major Findings:
1. LLMs can effectively simulate the participatory urban planning process by creating agents to simulate the planner and residents, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in residents' satisfaction and inclusion metrics.
2. The proposed planning framework incorporates residents' discussion and planner revision to better cater to residents' needs, achieving efficient and effective planning performance.
3. The method outperforms human experts in satisfying residents' needs as well as service accessibility and ecology metrics.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study simplifies planning elements and relies on manually designed prompts, potentially limiting the generalization ability of the method.
- The framework largely relies on manually designed prompts, especially for the planner, which may limit its generalization ability.
- The study acknowledges the need for future work to integrate the framework with human experts to construct a human-AI collaborative workflow and to apply the multi-agent collaboration design to other tasks involving a large number of agents.
