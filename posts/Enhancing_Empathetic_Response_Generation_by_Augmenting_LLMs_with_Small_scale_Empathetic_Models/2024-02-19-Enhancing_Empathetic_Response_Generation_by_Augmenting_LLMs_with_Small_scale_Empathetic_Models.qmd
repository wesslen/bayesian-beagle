### **Summary:**
- Empathetic response generation is a significant task in AI, requiring nuanced emotional and cognitive understanding coupled with articulate response expression.
- Current large language models (LLMs) excel in response expression but lack the ability to deeply understand emotional and cognitive nuances, particularly in pinpointing fine-grained emotions and their triggers.
- Small-scale empathetic models (SEMs) offer strength in fine-grained emotion detection and detailed emotion cause identification.
- To harness the complementary strengths of both LLMs and SEMs, a Hybrid Empathetic Framework (HEF) is introduced, which regards SEMs as flexible plugins to improve LLM's nuanced emotional and cognitive understanding.
- HEF implements a two-stage emotion prediction strategy and an emotion cause perception strategy to enhance LLM's emotional and cognitive capabilities.
- Experiments on the Empathetic-Dialogue dataset validate that HEF enhances the refined understanding of LLMs and their ability to convey empathetic responses.

### Major Findings:
1. HEF introduces a novel perspective of combining small-scale models with large language models for empathetic response generation.
2. The proposed non-fine-tuning framework effectively mitigates large language models' struggles in fine-grained emotional and cognitive understanding through a pluggable approach.
3. Experiments on the Empathetic-Dialogue dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the framework.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article presents a novel approach to enhancing empathetic response generation by combining the strengths of small-scale empathetic models and large language models. The proposed Hybrid Empathetic Framework (HEF) effectively addresses the limitations of large language models in understanding fine-grained emotions and cognitive nuances.
- However, the article does not thoroughly discuss potential ethical considerations and societal implications of using empathetic response generation models. Additionally, further research is needed to evaluate the generalizability of HEF to other tasks and datasets.
