### Summary:
The article introduces a novel method, GraphToken, for encoding structured data into large language models (LLMs). The method learns an encoding function to extend prompts with explicit structured information, allowing for significant improvements in graph reasoning tasks. The article also discusses the explosion of excitement around using LLMs to represent, process, and analyze textual data, as well as the challenges and limitations associated with current realizations of LLMs. The authors propose GraphToken as a parameter-efficient method for representing structured data for LLMs, demonstrating its significant improvement on the comprehensive GraphQA benchmark.

### Major Findings:
1. GraphToken demonstrates superior performance compared to established baselines across a comprehensive range of graph reasoning tasks, including graph-level, node-level, and edge-level tasks.
2. The performance of different graph convolution architectures varies across tasks, highlighting the importance of carefully choosing the right architecture for the specific graph reasoning problem at hand.
3. Learned positional embeddings generally outperform Laplacian position embeddings for most encoders and most tasks, breaking equivariance surprisingly adds additional capabilities for graph reasoning when powerful decoders are present.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article provides valuable insights into the challenges and limitations associated with current realizations of LLMs, as well as the potential of GraphToken in addressing these challenges.
- The experiments conducted in the article demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphToken in improving graph reasoning tasks, but further research is needed to explore its applications in factual grounding and other problems with very strong decoder models.
- The article's comprehensive analysis and experimental results provide a strong foundation for future work in the field of reasoning with structured data and LLMs.
