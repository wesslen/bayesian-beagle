### Summary:

The paper presents SpecExec, a speculative decoding method for running large language models (LLMs) on consumer machines. The method generates up to 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families, utilizing the high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution and a high degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the most probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a "cache" tree for the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass. The implementation code is available at <https://github.com/yandex-research/specexec>.

### Major Findings:

1. SpecExec can generate 10-20 accepted tokens with sufficiently large budgets, improving the structure of generated draft trees for very large token budgets.
2. Using SpecExec, 50B+ parameter LLMs can be run interactively at 4-6 tok/s using 4-bit quantization or 2-3 tok/s with 16-bit weights on consumer GPUs with offloading, with 10-18x speedups vs sequential inference on the same hardware.
3. SpecExec addresses the performance, flexibility, and scalability issues of prior methods, constructing a powerful draft model to deterministically build a large draft tree that covers the most likely continuations of the prefix using a parallel search algorithm.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other speculative decoding methods, making it difficult to assess the relative performance of SpecExec.
2. The paper assumes that consumer GPUs can no longer fit the largest available models (50B+ parameters) and must offload them to RAM or SSD. However, this may not always be the case, as some consumer GPUs may have sufficient memory to fit these models.
3. The paper does not discuss the potential impact of SpecExec on the quality of the generated text, which is an important consideration when evaluating the effectiveness of a decoding method.
4. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of SpecExec, making it difficult to assess its scalability and efficiency.
5. The paper does not discuss the potential limitations of SpecExec, such as its dependence on the quality of the draft model and the
