# Summary

The paper presents a novel approach to characterize conversational tones and their taxonomies in humans and Large Language Models (LLMs) using a human-in-the-loop Sampling with People (SP) technique. The method involves an iterative procedure where humans and LLMs are presented with sentences and asked to label their conversational tones in an open-ended fashion. The resulting conversational-tone terms are then presented to a new group of agents who are asked to produce sentences reflecting those conversational tones. This process is repeated multiple times, instantiating a Gibbs Sampler from the joint distribution of sentences and conversational tones.

The study addresses the challenges of biased apriori taxonomy and biased stimulus set in existing research on conversational tones. The proposed method enables the characterization of conversational tones and their taxonomies in any target human population as well as LLMs, without relying on predefined taxonomies or constrained sets of stimuli.

The paper also presents an additional experiment where humans and GPT-4 annotated all sentences with all tones. The data from 1,339 human participants, 33,370 human judgments, and 29,900 GPT-4 queries were used to create an interpretable geometric representation of relations between conversational tones in humans and GPT-4. This work demonstrates how combining ideas from machine learning and cognitive science can address challenges in human-computer interactions.
