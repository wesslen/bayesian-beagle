### Summary:

The paper proposes a new approach for a few-shot personalization of large language models (LLMs) called Fermi. The key idea is to learn a set of personalized prompts for each user by progressively improving the prompts using LLMs, based on user profile and a few examples of previous opinions. The approach incorporates the contexts of mis-aligned responses by LLMs, which are crucial for effective personalization. The paper also presents an effective inference method to further leverage the context of the test query and the personalized prompts. The experimental results demonstrate that Fermi significantly improves performance across various benchmarks compared to the best-performing baselines.

### Major Findings:

1. Fermi is a new approach for a few-shot personalization of LLMs that learns a set of personalized prompts for each user by progressively improving the prompts using LLMs, based on user profile and a few examples of previous opinions.
2. The approach incorporates the contexts of mis-aligned responses by LLMs, which are crucial for effective personalization.
3. Fermi significantly improves performance across various benchmarks compared to the best-performing baselines.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel approach for personalizing LLMs, which is a crucial problem as the diversity of users increases. The proposed approach, Fermi, addresses the limitations of existing approaches by learning a set of personalized prompts for each user and incorporating the contexts of mis-aligned responses by LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Fermi in improving performance across various benchmarks.

However, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison of Fermi with other state-of-the-art personalization methods. It would be interesting to see how Fermi compares to other approaches in terms of performance, computational efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations and biases of the proposed approach. For instance, the approach relies on the availability of user profile and a few examples of previous opinions, which may not always be available or reliable. It would be important to investigate these issues in future work.
