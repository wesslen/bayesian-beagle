**Summary of the Article:**

The article presents a method for question answering (QA) over a combination of tabular and textual data using a specialized language model. The hybrid content, such as SEC filings and financial reports, requires discrete reasoning capabilities. The authors propose a Step-wise Pipeline, comprising Extractor, Reasoner, and Executor, to address the QA task and validate that GPT-4 outperforms existing methods. However, the challenges of using GPT-4, including cost and latency, lead to the development of a specialized language model, TAT-LLM, based on LLaMA 2. Experimental results verify that TAT-LLM outperforms all baseline models and even large-scale LLMs like GPT-4 on various benchmarks.

### Major Findings:
1. The Step-wise Pipeline: The article introduces the Step-wise Pipeline comprising Extractor, Reasoner, and Executor, representing different abilities for tabular and textual QA. This approach emphasizes the importance of intermediate results, enhancing discrete reasoning capabilities in practical scenarios.
2. TAT-LLM Outperforms Existing Methods: The specialized language model, TAT-LLM, developed using fine-tuning from LLaMA 2, demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models and large-scale LLMs, confirming the potential of smaller language models for specific tasks.
3. Challenges and Need for Specialization: The limitations of existing large language models, such as GPT-4, lead to the development of TAT-LLM to address challenges related to cost, latency, and data security risks, which is validated through experimental results.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article offers a valuable contribution by proposing a specialized language model, TAT-LLM, for discrete reasoning over tabular and textual data. However, the study primarily focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model, with an emphasis on performance comparisons and experimental results. The article lacks in-depth discussions on the potential drawbacks or limitations of the proposed approach. Additionally, while the experimental results are promising, they could benefit from a more comprehensive investigation of different use cases, potential biases in the models, and practical use scenarios. Further research and analysis could explore the generalizability of the proposed model to other domains and tasks and address any potential biases or ethical considerations associated with model development and deployment. This would enhance the overall impact and relevance of the proposed approach for real-world applications.
