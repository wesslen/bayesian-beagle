The paper presents a novel approach called RankEF, which utilizes execution feedback to enhance the efficiency of code ranking. The method integrates execution feedback and classification labels using multi-task learning, enabling the ranker to understand the underlying factors contributing to diverse code errors. The experimental results demonstrate that RankEF outperforms existing baseline methods due to its profound grasp of error causality. The paper also provides the availability of the experimental dataset and source code for further research.
