### Summary:
- The article investigates the integration of Differential Privacy (DP) in the training of Mixture of Experts (MoE) models within natural language processing.
- Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to billions of parameters, raising computational and privacy concerns.
- The study explores the potential of MoE models and the application of DP to address these issues.
- Initial experimental studies demonstrate that MoE models can be effectively trained with DP, achieving competitive performance with their non-private counterparts.

### Major Findings:
1. MoE models can be effectively trained with DP, achieving competitive performance with their non-private counterparts.
2. The study addresses the challenges posed by the MoE architecture and the complexities of DP integration.
3. The research provides valuable insights and ignites further research in the domain of privacy-preserving MoE models.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges and potential solutions for training MoE models with DP.
- The study's initial experimental results demonstrate promising outcomes, but further research is needed to address the larger gap between non-private and private fine-tuning performances for certain datasets.
- The article highlights the need for efficient implementation of DP for state-of-the-art models with trillions of parameters, as well as the potential for further improvements in private fine-tuning of MoE models.
