**Summary:**

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of 158 papers on computational perspectives on toxic memes, covering key developments up to early 2024. The study identifies a wide variety of terminology used to refer to toxic memes, highlighting the need for a clearer taxonomy and harmonized definitions. The authors introduce a novel taxonomy and offer insights into various dimensions of meme toxicity, including intent, target, and conveyance tactics. The paper also catalogs datasets containing toxic memes, analyzes prevalent challenges, and identifies emerging trends in computational approaches to toxic meme detection and interpretation. The survey aims to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation to foster media literacy and a safer online ecosystem.

**Major Findings:**

1. The study identifies 12 meme toxicity terms and provides a harmonized set of definitions, addressing the need for a clearer taxonomy and harmonized definitions.
2. The authors introduce a novel taxonomy for categorizing meme toxicity types and offer insights into various dimensions of meme toxicity, including intent, target, and conveyance tactics.
3. The paper catalogs over 30 datasets containing toxic memes and analyzes prevalent challenges in computational approaches to toxic meme detection and interpretation.
4. The survey identifies emerging trends in computational approaches to toxic meme detection and interpretation, including enhancing interpretability through sophisticated cross-modal reasoning, background knowledge integration, attention on low-resource languages, and refining the usage of LLMs.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper provides a comprehensive survey of the literature on computational perspectives on toxic memes, offering valuable insights into the current state of the field. The introduction of a novel taxonomy and harmonized definitions is a significant contribution, as it addresses the need for a clearer taxonomy and harmonized definitions. The paper also identifies emerging trends in computational approaches to toxic meme detection and interpretation, which can guide future research in the field.

However, the paper does not provide a critical analysis of the limitations and biases of the existing literature. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential ethical implications of using computational approaches to detect and interpret toxic memes. Future research should address these limitations and consider the ethical implications of using computational approaches to detect and interpret toxic
