### **Summary:**
- AmbigNLG is a new task designed to address task ambiguity in instructions for Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks.
- The study introduces a dataset, AmbigSNI, consisting of 2,500 instances, and develops an ambiguity taxonomy for categorizing and annotating instruction ambiguities.
- The approach demonstrates substantial improvements in text generation quality, highlighting the critical role of clear and specific instructions in enhancing LLM performance in NLG tasks.

### **Major Findings:**
1. AmbigNLG seeks to identify and mitigate ambiguities in instructions, aiming to refine instructions to match user expectations better.
2. The study introduces an ambiguity taxonomy to categorize different types of instruction ambiguity in NLG tasks systematically.
3. The proposed approach yields significant improvements, with an increase of up to 15.02 points in the ROUGE-L F1 score.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The proposed method resolves ambiguity based on the ambiguity taxonomy observed in the data, but it cannot handle ambiguities that fall outside of these predefined categories.
- The study does not address how to select the appropriate complementation strategy when presenting multiple additional instructions to the user.
- The proposed method incurs minimal additional costs, making it a cost-effective approach for enhancing performance in NLG tasks.

### **Related Work:**
- The study can be positioned within the scope of prompt optimization, refining text prompts to enhance downstream task performance.
- Ambiguity is a long-standing problem in NLP, and the study specifically focused on task ambiguity that arises when a model faces unclear, incomplete, or contradictory instructions or data.

### **Conclusion:**
- The study introduced AmbigNLG, a novel task that addresses the task ambiguity in instructions for NLG, and demonstrated significant improvements in text generation quality.
- The proposed approach can significantly bring the generated text closer to what the user desires, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing human-computer interaction through natural language.
