### Summary:
- The article introduces the Information Retention Quantization of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Information Retention (IR-QLoRA) to improve the accuracy of quantized LLMs. It relies on Information Calibration Quantization (ICQ) and Information Elastic Connection (IEC) to achieve this.
- The proposed IR-QLoRA significantly improves accuracy across LLaMA and LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, with only a small increase in time consumption.
- The evaluation of the proposed IR-QLoRA method on the LLaMA2 models and the ablation study reveal its effectiveness in enhancing accuracy and efficiency.

### Major Findings:
1. IR-QLoRA significantly improves accuracy across LLaMA and LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths.
2. ICQ and IEC effectively enhance the mutual information between quantized weights of LLMs and original counterparts, reducing information loss and producing accuracy gain.
3. IR-QLoRA exhibits strong generalization across different LLM families and achieves performance improvement.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The proposed IR-QLoRA method shows significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising solution for deploying LLMs on resource-constrained hardware.
- The introduction of ICQ and IEC technologies provides a clear framework for understanding the proposed approach and its potential impact on the field of LLM quantization.
- The results of the evaluation and ablation studies highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency achieved by IR-QLoRA, showcasing its strong capabilities in constructing accurate and efficient LLMs.
- The experiment settings and evaluation metrics outlined in the article are crucial for understanding the effectiveness of IR-QLoRA in improving the efficiency and performance of LLMs.
