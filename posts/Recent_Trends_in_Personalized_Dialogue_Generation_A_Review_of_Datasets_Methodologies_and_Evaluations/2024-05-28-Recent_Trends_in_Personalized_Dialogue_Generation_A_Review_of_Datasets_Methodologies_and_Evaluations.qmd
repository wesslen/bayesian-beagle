### Summary:

This paper provides a systematic survey of recent trends in personalized dialogue generation, focusing on datasets, methodologies, and evaluations. The authors cover 22 datasets, highlighting benchmark datasets and newer ones with additional features. They analyze 17 seminal works from top conferences between 2021-2023, identifying five distinct types of problems. The paper also discusses recent progress by LLMs in personalized dialogue generation and offers a comprehensive summary of assessment facets and metrics utilized in these works. The authors conclude by discussing prevailing challenges and envisioning prospect directions for future research in personalized dialogue generation.

### Major Findings:

1. The paper covers 22 datasets, including benchmark datasets and newer ones with additional features, such as persona grounding, multi-session dialogues, and augmented features like knowledge, empathy, and vision.
2. The authors analyze 17 seminal works from top conferences between 2021-2023, identifying five distinct types of problems: Consistency and Coherence, Persona-Context Balancing, Relevant Persona Selection, Unknown Persona Modeling, and Data Scarcity.
3. The paper discusses recent progress by LLMs in personalized dialogue generation, highlighting their ability to reflect personas or personality traits provided in prompts.
4. The evaluation section offers a comprehensive summary of assessment facets and metrics utilized in these works, including fluency, diversity, coherence, and personalization.
5. The authors discuss prevailing challenges and envision prospect directions for future research in personalized dialogue generation, such as addressing data scarcity, improving evaluation metrics, and exploring the use of LLMs for personalized dialogue generation.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent trends in personalized dialogue generation, covering a wide range of datasets, methodologies, and evaluations.
2. The authors' identification of five distinct types of problems in personalized dialogue generation is a valuable contribution to the field, as it helps to clarify the current state of research and identify areas for future work.
3. The paper's discussion of recent progress by LLMs in personalized dialogue generation is timely and relevant, given the increasing interest in LLMs for natural language processing tasks.
