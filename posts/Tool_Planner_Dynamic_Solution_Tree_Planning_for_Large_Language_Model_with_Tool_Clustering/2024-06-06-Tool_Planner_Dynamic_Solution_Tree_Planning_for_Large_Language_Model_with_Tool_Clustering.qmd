**Summary:**
The paper introduces Tool-Planner, a task-processing framework that groups tools based on their API functions into toolkits. This approach allows large language models (LLMs) to implement planning across various toolkits and reselect or adjust tools when a tool error occurs. The authors propose Tool-Planner to address the challenges of redundant error correction and designing a correct plan among multiple tools in tool learning. The experiments conducted demonstrate that Tool-Planner has a high pass and win rate across different datasets and optimizes the planning scheme for tool learning in models such as GPT-4 and Claude 3.

**Major Findings:**
1. Tool-Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance on five out of six datasets and shows competitive performance on the remaining dataset.
2. The method improves the pass rate by +8.8% and the win rate by +9.1% compared to the
