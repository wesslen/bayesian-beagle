### Summary:

The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, into education has the potential to revolutionize students' learning experiences. However, understanding students' interaction patterns with ChatGPT is crucial for instructors to harness its full potential. To address this challenge, the authors collected conversational data from 48 students interacting with ChatGPT in a master's level data visualization course over one semester. They then developed a coding scheme, grounded in cognitive levels and thematic analysis, to categorize students' interaction patterns with ChatGPT. The authors also present a visual analytics system, StuGPTViz, that tracks and compares temporal patterns in student prompts and the quality of ChatGPT's responses at multiple scales, revealing significant pedagogical insights for instructors. The system's effectiveness was validated through expert interviews with six data visualization instructors and three case studies.

### Major Findings:

1. The integration of ChatGPT into a data visualization course allowed for the collection of high-quality student-ChatGPT conversation data from well-crafted learning tasks.
2. A comprehensive coding scheme was developed to categorize the diverse cognitive levels and several metrics to evaluate the quality of ChatGPT responses.
3. The visual analytics system, StuGPTViz, was designed to help instructors discover insights into students' cognitive levels and proficiency when using ChatGPT.
4. The coding scheme and system were found to be effective in enhancing educational activities such as problem-solving guidance, personalized feedback, and exercise design.

### Analysis and Critique:

The study presents a design study that constitutes an initial yet crucial step toward analyzing student interaction patterns with ChatGPT, advancing the application of visual analytics in AI-driven education. However, the following points should be considered:

1. The study focuses on a single course and a specific LLM, ChatGPT. Further research is needed to generalize the findings to other courses and LLMs.
2. The coding scheme and system were validated through expert interviews and case studies, but the sample size was relatively small. A larger sample size would provide more robust evidence of the system's effectiveness.
3. The study does not discuss the potential ethical implications of using LLMs in education, such
