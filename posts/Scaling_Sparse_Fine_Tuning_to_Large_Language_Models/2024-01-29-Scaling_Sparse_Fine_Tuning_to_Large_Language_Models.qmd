### Summary:

The article introduces the concept of Sparse Fine-Tuning (SFT) for Large Language Models (LLMs) and discusses the challenges associated with it. It presents the SFT-AG and SFT-MA methods, explores their compatibility with quantization and efficient optimizers, and discusses the hyperparameter search for sparsely fine-tuning large language models.

### Major Findings:
1. The SFT-AG method demonstrates superior performance and memory usage trade-offs compared to other methods.
2. The performance of different quantized PEFT methods and their trade-offs in terms of performance, memory usage, and training speed are highlighted.
3. The hyperparameter search provides valuable insights into the optimal configurations for different SFT methods, contributing to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of training large language models with sparse fine-tuning.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the challenges and solutions related to sparse fine-tuning for Large Language Models. However, it is important to critically evaluate the potential biases and limitations of the methods presented, as well as the need for further research to address computational efficiency and potential shortcomings in the SFT techniques. Additionally, the practical implications of these methods in real-world applications should be further explored to assess their broader impact.
