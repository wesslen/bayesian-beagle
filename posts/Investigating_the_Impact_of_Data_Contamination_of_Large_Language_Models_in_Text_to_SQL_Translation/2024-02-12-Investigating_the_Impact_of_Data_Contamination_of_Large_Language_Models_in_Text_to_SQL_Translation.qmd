### Summary:
Understanding textual description to generate code seems to be an achieved capability of instruction-following Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot scenario. However, there is a severe possibility that this translation ability may be influenced by having seen target textual descriptions and the related code. This effect is known as Data Contamination. In this study, the impact of Data Contamination on the performance of GPT-3.5 in the Text-to-SQL code-generating tasks is investigated. The study introduces a novel method to detect Data Contamination in GPTs and examines GPT-3.5’s Text-to-SQL performances using the known Spider Dataset and a new unfamiliar dataset Termite. The study also analyzes GPT-3.5’s efficacy on databases with modified information via an adversarial table disconnection (ATD) approach, complicating Text-to-SQL tasks by removing structural pieces of information from the database. The results indicate a significant performance drop in GPT-3.5 on the unfamiliar Termite dataset, even with ATD modifications, highlighting the effect of Data Contamination on LLMs in Text-to-SQL translation tasks.

### Major Findings:
1. GPT-3.5 exhibits clear knowledge about Spider, leading to an overestimation of the model’s performance in Text-to-SQL tasks in zero-shot scenarios.
2. The average DC-accuracy over Spider datasets is more than 40%, while the average DC-accuracy over Termite datasets is lower, indicating the presence of data contamination.
3. GPT-3.5’s performance on the Text-to-SQL task is significantly better on the Spider dataset compared to the Termite dataset, suggesting that data contamination influences the model's performance.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study provides valuable insights into the impact of Data Contamination on the performance of GPT-3.5 in Text-to-SQL tasks.
- The study is limited to GPT-3.5 and could be extended to other models to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of Data Contamination.
- The analysis of column names in Spider and Termite datasets ensures the equivalence in terms of abbreviations and compound nouns, which is crucial for a fair evaluation during the estimation of data contamination.
- The study acknowledges the limitations and suggests future work to address them, indicating a thorough and critical approach to the research.
