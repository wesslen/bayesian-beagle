    "text": "Federated Learning and Its Vulnerabilities: The paper highlights the concept of federated learning, where multiple entities collaboratively train models using their private data. It emphasizes that despite its advantages, federated learning is susceptible to data injection attacks, which can compromise the learning process and lead to a suboptimal model.\nDetection and Mitigation Technique: The paper proposes a novel local scheme for detecting and mitigating data injection attacks in federated learning systems. The technique involves comparing updates from participating agents and ignoring updates from suspicious agents. A threshold-based mechanism is employed for attacker localization and subsequent mitigation.\nSimulation Results: The paper presents simulation results showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed technique in detecting and mitigating data injection attacks. It demonstrates mitigating attacks such as constant-output attacks and label-flipping attacks, highlighting the ability of the algorithm to maintain convergence of the model to a truthful model."
