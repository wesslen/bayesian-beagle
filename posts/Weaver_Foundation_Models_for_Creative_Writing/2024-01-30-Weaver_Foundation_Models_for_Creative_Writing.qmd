**Summary:**

- Weaver is a family of large language models (LLMs) dedicated to content creation, pre-trained on a carefully selected corpus focusing on improving writing capabilities.
- Weaver models are fine-tuned for creative and professional writing purposes, aligning them to the preference of professional writers using novel methods for instruction data synthesis and LLM alignment.
- The Weaver family consists of models of varying sizes (Mini, Base, Pro, and Ultra) suitable for different applications and can be dynamically dispatched by a routing agent according to query complexity to balance response quality and computation cost.
- Evaluation on a WriteBench benchmark shows that Weaver models of all sizes outperform generalist LLMs several times larger than them, with the Weaver Ultra model surpassing GPT-4 in various writing scenarios.
- Weaver supports retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and function calling (tool usage), which can improve AI-assisted writing systems, such as integration of external knowledge bases, tools, or APIs, and providing personalized writing assistance.
- A guideline and best practices for pre-training and fine-tuning domain-specific LLMs are discussed and summarized.

**Major Findings:**

1. Weaver, a family of LLMs dedicated to content creation, outperforms generalist LLMs in writing tasks, even those much larger in size.
2. Weaver supports retrieval-augmented generation and function calling, enabling various use cases for improving AI-assisted writing systems.
3. A carefully curated benchmark, WriteBench, is presented for assessing the writing capabilities of LLMs, which highlights Weaver's superior performance.

**Analysis and Critique:**

- The paper lacks a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art LLMs, making it difficult to fully assess Weaver's performance and contributions to the field.
- The evaluation section could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the methods and metrics used to compare Weaver with other LLMs.
- The paper could provide more information on the limitations and potential biases of Weaver, as well as discuss potential improvements and future research directions.
- The Weaver models' performance is impressive, but the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion on the ethical
