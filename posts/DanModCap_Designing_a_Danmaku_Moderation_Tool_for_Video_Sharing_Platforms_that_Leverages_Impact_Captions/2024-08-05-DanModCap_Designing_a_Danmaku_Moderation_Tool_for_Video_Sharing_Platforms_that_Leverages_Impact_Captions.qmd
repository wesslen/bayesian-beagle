### Summary:

The article presents a novel approach to moderating Danmaku comments on video-sharing platforms using a tool called DanModCap. DanModCap leverages Impact Captions, a concept inspired by East Asian variety shows, to guide viewers towards positive Danmaku-related activities and elicit prosocial behaviors. The tool collects and analyzes Danmaku comments and uses them as input to large generative language models to produce Impact Captions. The evaluation of DanModCap demonstrated that Impact Captions reduced negative antagonistic emotions, increased users’ desire to share positive content, and elicited self-control in Danmaku social action to foster proactive community maintenance behaviors. The approach highlights the benefits of using LLM-supported content moderation methods for proactive moderation in large-scale live content contexts.

### Major Findings:

1. Impact Captions, inspired by East Asian variety shows, can be used to guide viewers towards positive Danmaku-related activities and elicit prosocial behaviors.
2. DanModCap, a tool for Danmaku content moderation, uses generative AI to create Impact Captions that can reduce negative antagonistic emotions, increase users’ desire to share positive content, and elicit self-control in Danmaku social action.
3. The use of LLM-supported content moderation methods for proactive moderation in large-scale live content contexts can be beneficial.

### Analysis and Critique:

The article presents an innovative approach to moderating Danmaku comments on video-sharing platforms using Impact Captions. The use of Impact Captions to guide viewers towards positive Danmaku-related activities and elicit prosocial behaviors is a novel concept that has the potential to improve the user experience on these platforms. The evaluation of DanModCap demonstrated positive results, indicating that the tool can effectively reduce negative antagonistic emotions, increase users’ desire to share positive content, and elicit self-control in Danmaku social action.

However, there are some potential limitations and areas for further research. The article does not provide a detailed description of the methodology used to evaluate DanModCap, making it difficult to assess the validity of the findings. Additionally, the use of LLM-supported content moderation methods for proactive moderation in large-scale live content contexts is a relatively new approach
