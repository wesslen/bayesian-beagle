# Summary:

The paper presents a novel method called AutoBreach for jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) that only requires black-box access. The method is inspired by the versatility of wordplay and employs a wordplay-guided mapping rule sampling strategy to generate a variety of universal mapping rules for creating adversarial prompts. The generation process leverages LLMs' automatic summarization and reasoning capabilities, thus alleviating the manual burden. To boost jailbreak success rates, sentence compression and chain-of-thought-based mapping rules are suggested to correct errors and wordplay misinterpretations in target LLMs. Additionally, a two-stage mapping rule optimization strategy is proposed that initially optimizes mapping rules before querying target LLMs to enhance the efficiency of AutoBreach. The method can efficiently identify security vulnerabilities across various LLMs, achieving an average success rate of over 80% with fewer than 10 queries.
