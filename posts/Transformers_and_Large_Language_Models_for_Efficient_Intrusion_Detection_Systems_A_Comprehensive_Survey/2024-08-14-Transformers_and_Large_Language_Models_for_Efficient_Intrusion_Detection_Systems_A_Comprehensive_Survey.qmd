**Summary:**

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the utilization of Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs) in cyber-threat detection systems. The methodology of paper selection and bibliometric analysis is outlined to establish a rigorous framework for evaluating existing research. The fundamentals of Transformers are discussed, including various cyber-attacks and datasets commonly used in this field. The survey explores the application of Transformers in intrusion detection systems (IDSs), focusing on different architectures such as Attention-based models, LLMs like BERT and GPT, CNN/LSTM-Transformer hybrids, and emerging approaches like Vision Transformers (ViTs). The survey also explores the diverse environments and applications where Transformers and LLMs-based IDS have been implemented, including computer networks, IoT devices, critical infrastructure protection, cloud computing, software-defined networking (SDN), and autonomous vehicles (AVs). The paper concludes by summarizing the findings and highlighting the significance of Transformers and LLMs in enhancing cyber-threat detection capabilities, while also outlining potential avenues for further research and development.
