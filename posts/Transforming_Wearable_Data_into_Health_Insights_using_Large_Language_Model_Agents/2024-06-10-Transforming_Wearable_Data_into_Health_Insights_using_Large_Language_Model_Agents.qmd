**Summary:**
The paper presents a study on the Personal Health Insights Agent (PHIA), an AI model designed to answer personal health queries using wearable data. PHIA outperforms the Code Generation baseline by 14% (84% vs. 74%) in exact matching accuracy for objective personal health queries. In open-ended reasoning quality, PHIA demonstrates a significant advantage over the Code Generation baseline in all ratings except for personalization. Expert evaluation shows that PHIA has a significant advantage over the Code Generation baseline in overall code quality, avoiding hallucinations, and personalization. PHIA is also quantitatively less likely to generate code that raises an error.

**Major Findings:**
1. PHIA outperforms the Code Generation baseline by 14% in exact matching accuracy for objective personal health queries.
2. PHIA demonstrates a significant advantage over the Code Generation baseline in open-ended reasoning quality.
