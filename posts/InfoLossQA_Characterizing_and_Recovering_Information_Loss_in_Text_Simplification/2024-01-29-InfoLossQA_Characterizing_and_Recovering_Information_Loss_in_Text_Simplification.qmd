The appendix includes the annotation and evaluation guidelines for the InfoLossQA task. This includes detailed instructions for annotating the dataset, as well as guidelines for evaluating the quality of the generated QA pairs. The guidelines cover various aspects such as identifying deletions and oversimplifications, scenario grounding, and a checklist for a good QA pair. Additionally, the guidelines for evaluating the quality of the generated QA pairs include criteria for question givenness, question localization, answer simplicity, answerability/question relevance, and answer accuracy. The appendix also includes figures showing the annotation interface and the interface for quality assessment of QA.
