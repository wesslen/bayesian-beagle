# Summary:

The paper "EnJa: Ensemble Jailbreak on Large Language Models" by Jiahao Zhang et al. introduces the concept of Ensemble Jailbreak (EnJa) and explores methods to integrate prompt-level and token-level jailbreak into a more powerful hybrid jailbreak attack. The authors propose a novel EnJa attack that hides harmful instructions using prompt-level jailbreak, boosts the attack success rate using a gradient-based attack, and connects the two types of jailbreak attacks via a template-based connector. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of EnJa on several aligned models and shows that it achieves a state-of-the-art attack success rate with fewer queries and is much stronger than any individual jailbreak.

## Major Findings:

1. The proposed EnJa attack achieves a state-of-the-art attack success rate with fewer queries and is much stronger than any individual jailbreak.
2. The EnJa attack integrates prompt-level and token-level jailbreak into a more powerful hybrid jailbreak attack.
3. The EnJa attack hides harmful instructions using prompt-level jailbreak and boosts the attack success rate using a gradient-based attack.
4. The EnJa attack connects the two types of jailbreak attacks via a template-based connector.

## Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents an interesting approach to jailbreaking large language models by integrating prompt-level and token-level jailbreak into a more powerful hybrid attack. The proposed EnJa attack achieves a state-of-the-art attack success rate with fewer queries and is much stronger than any individual jailbreak. However, the paper does not discuss the potential risks and ethical implications of such attacks. It is important to consider the potential harm that could be caused by malicious actors using these techniques to generate harmful content. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed approach. Further research is needed to evaluate the robustness and generalizability of the EnJa attack and to develop effective countermeasures.
