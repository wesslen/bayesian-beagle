It also introduces a suite of efficient Secure Multi-Party Computing (SMPC) protocols that handle complex nonlinear functions within PPI, such as Softmax, GeLU, and LayerNorm.\nPerformance and Efficiency: Experimental results demonstrate that SecFormer outperforms existing frameworks in both performance and efficiency, showing improvements in the performance of BERTBASE and BERTLARGE models and being significantly faster than previous methods."
