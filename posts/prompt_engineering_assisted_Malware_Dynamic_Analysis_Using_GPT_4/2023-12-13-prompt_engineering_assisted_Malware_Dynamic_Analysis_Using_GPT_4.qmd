# Prompt Engineering-assisted Malware Dynamic Analysis Using GPT-4

## Overview

### Major Takeaways
1. **API Sequence as Dynamic Malware Behavior**: The API sequence, composed of consecutive API calls, is a significant representation of dynamic malware behavior in dynamic analysis methods.
2. **Introduction of Prompt Engineering & GPT-4**: This paper introduces a method for generating representations for API calls using GPT-4 and prompt engineering, achieving excellent detection performance in dynamic malware analysis.
3. **Superior Generalization Performance**: The proposed model demonstrates superior generalization performance, effectively addressing issues such as weak generalization and concept drift in dynamic malware analysis.

## Experiment Analysis

### Comparison of Representation Quality
- The proposed model outperforms existing models in generating denser representations and capturing associations between API calls effectively, as demonstrated in case studies.
- Few-shot learning experiments show that the proposed model achieves superior fine-tuning and adaptation in comparison to TextCNN and BiLSTM.

### Analysis of Concept Drift Alleviation
- The proposed model effectively addresses the concept drift phenomenon, demonstrating excellent recall rates for malware even in the presence of new or previously unseen API calls.

## Critique
- The paper could benefit from more detailed information on the limitations or potential biases of the proposed method.
- Further clarification on the real-world applicability and scalability of the proposed model would enhance the paper's significance.

Overall, the paper provides a promising approach to dynamic malware analysis, but further studies and real-world implementations are required to validate its full potential.
