### Major Findings
- The dialogue system developed for the Dialogue Robot Competition 2023 achieved **topic control for trip planning** by inserting text into prompts using the ChatGPT-API.
- The system is capable of **generating compliments** for the user based on recognition of the user’s appearance and creating travel plans by extracting knowledge about the user’s preferences from the history of the user’s utterances.
- The system was evaluated in a preliminary round at a travel agency’s actual store, and the results showed the **effectiveness** of the proposed system in terms of customer satisfaction and plan creation.

### Proposed System
- **Controlling topics with ChatGPT prompts**
  - Utilized GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 to create a travel plan by inserting fixed text in the prompts.
- **Dialogue Flow**
  - Elicited customer requests, determined tourist destinations, confirmed customer requirements, and discussed a travel plan that meets the customer’s needs.
- **Function to complement a user’s physical appearance**
  - Recognized and praised the user’s appearance characteristics such as clothing color, shade, eyeglasses, beauty quotient, and personality.
- **Control using user’s past speech**
  - Extracted information from the user’s past speech to create travel plans and decisions on sightseeing spots.

### User Evaluation and Preliminary Results
- The system was evaluated based on satisfaction and plan creation, and it ranked first in both satisfaction rating and plan rating in the preliminary round.

### Critique
- The paper lacks in-depth technical details regarding the **implementation of ChatGPT** and its integration with the dialogue system.
- The evaluation of the system was based on a single round of testing, which may not be sufficient to draw definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy in the long term.
- The **generalizability** of the system's performance across different customer service scenarios and user demographics is not discussed.
