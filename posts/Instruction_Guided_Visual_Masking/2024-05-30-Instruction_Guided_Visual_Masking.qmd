### Summary:

The paper introduces Instruction-guided Visual Masking (IVM), a versatile plug-and-play model designed to enhance multimodal instruction following via nuanced surgical visual grounding. IVM aims to eliminate the distraction of instruction-irrelevant visual regions by automatically masking them out, allowing multimodal models to focus on task-related visual content. The authors propose a visual masking data generation pipeline and create an IVM-Mix-1M dataset with 1 million image-instruction pairs. They also introduce a new learning technique, Discriminator Weighted Supervised Learning (DWSL), for preferential IVM training that prioritizes high-quality data samples. Experimental results demonstrate the versatility of IVM, which significantly boosts the performance of diverse multimodal models across challenging multimodal benchmarks.

### Major Findings:

1. IVM is a versatile plug-and-play model that enhances multimodal instruction following by surgically targeting visual grounding.
2. The authors propose a visual masking data generation pipeline and create an IVM-Mix-1M dataset with 1 million image-instruction pairs.
