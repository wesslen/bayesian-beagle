**Summary:**

The paper introduces Patchview, a customizable LLM-powered system that aids worldbuilding by allowing users to interact with story concepts and elements through the physical metaphor of magnets and dust. Elements in Patchview are visually dragged closer to concepts with high relevance, facilitating sensemaking. The user can also steer the generation with verbally elusive concepts by indicating the desired position of the element between concepts. When the user disagrees with the LLM’s visualization and generation, they can correct those by repositioning the element. These corrections can be used to align the LLM’s future behaviors to the user’s perception. A user study shows that Patchview supports the sensemaking of world elements and steering of element generation, facilitating exploration during the worldbuilding process. Patchview provides insights on how customizable visual representation can help sensemake, steer, and align generative AI model behaviors with the user’s intentions.

**Major Findings:**

1. Patchview supports the sensemaking of world elements by placing elements close to concepts of high relevance, similar to how magnets attract iron dust particles.
2. The system supports generation steering and AI behavior correction by leveraging the visual space configured by concepts.
3. A user study showed that Patchview could facilitate understanding the landscape of story world elements and steering of element generation with nuanced intentions that are difficult to express in natural language alone.

**Analysis and Critique:**

While Patchview provides a novel approach to interacting with generative AI models, there are potential limitations and areas for improvement. The interaction of correcting misaligned AI results was intuitive, but those corrections minimally improved the alignment of AI behaviors to the user’s perception, indicating one possible direction for future work. Additionally, the system's usability and functionalities could be improved, such as adding filtering functions to the list module and better handling under-specified or irrelevant concepts. The study involved only a single session, and future work might investigate the use of Patchview for long-term projects, including the extension of already existing story worlds. Furthermore, the design of Patchview was not compared to other alternatives when the user creates their own story world with LLMs. Future work may investigate comparison to other tools.
