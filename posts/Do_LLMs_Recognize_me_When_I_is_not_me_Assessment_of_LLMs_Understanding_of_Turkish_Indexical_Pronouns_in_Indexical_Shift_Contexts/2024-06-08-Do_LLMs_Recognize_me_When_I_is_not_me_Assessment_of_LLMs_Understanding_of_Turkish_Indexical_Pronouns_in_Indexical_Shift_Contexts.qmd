### Summary:
- The study focuses on the Indexical Shift problem in Turkish, a grammatical challenge not present in high-resource languages like English.
- The authors present the first study examining indexical shift in any language, releasing a Turkish dataset specifically designed for this purpose.
- The Indexical Shift Dataset consists of 156 multiple-choice questions, each annotated with necessary linguistic details, to evaluate LLMs in a few-shot setting.
- The study evaluates recent multilingual LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Cohere-AYA, Trendyol-LLM, and Turkcell-LLM, using this dataset.
- The analysis reveals that even advanced models like GPT-4 struggle with the grammatical nuances of indexical shift in Turkish, achieving only moderate performance.
- These findings underscore the need for focused research on the grammatical challenges posed by low-resource languages.

### Major Findings:
1. The study presents the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on the indexical shift problem in Turkish.
2. The evaluation of recent multilingual LLMs using this dataset reveals that even advanced models like GPT-4 struggle with the grammatical nuances of indexical shift in Turkish.
3. The findings highlight the need for focused research on the grammatical challenges posed by low-resource languages.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study focuses on a unique linguistic challenge related to but distinct from pronoun resolution, primarily encountered in low-resource languages like Turkish.
- The authors acknowledge the limitation of focusing solely on the first person indexical in Turkish due to linguistic limitations regarding indexical shift in Turkish.
- The study does not investigate the second person indexical sen, which does not allow indexical shift in any other verb than de ‘to say’.
- Future work can extend the findings by investigating LLMs’ performance with other indexical elements than the first person ben.
- The study does not discuss the potential implications of these findings for the development and evaluation of LLMs in other low-resource languages.
- The authors do not provide a detailed comparison of the performance of the evaluated LLMs, which could provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
- The study does not
