### **Summary:**
- SiLLM is a framework designed to conduct Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) with Large Language Models (LLM).
- The SiLLM framework delegates the SiMT task into policy-decision and translation sub-tasks, assigning them to separate agents, thereby incorporating LLM into SiMT.
- SiLLM utilizes a policy-decision agent managed by a conventional SiMT model and a translation agent employing an LLM to generate translations using partial source sentences.
- The framework introduces a word-level policy adapted for LLM and incorporates Supervised Fine-Tuning to enhance the translation capability of LLM.
- Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that, with a small amount of data for fine-tuning LLM, SiLLM attains state-of-the-art performance in SiMT.

### Major Findings:
1. SiLLM delegates the SiMT task into policy-decision and translation sub-tasks, assigning them to separate agents, thereby incorporating LLM into SiMT.
2. The framework introduces a word-level policy adapted for LLM and incorporates Supervised Fine-Tuning to enhance the translation capability of LLM.
3. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that, with a small amount of data for fine-tuning LLM, SiLLM attains state-of-the-art performance in SiMT.

### Analysis and Critique:
- SiLLM's approach of decomposing the SiMT task into policy-decision and translation sub-tasks and assigning them to different agents is a novel and effective strategy.
- The framework's ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance with a small amount of data for fine-tuning LLM is a significant advantage.
- The experiments demonstrate that SiLLM's approach is practical and beneficial for SiMT tasks.
- The limitations of the study include the exploration of more powerful translation agents or better policy-decision agents to further improve performance.
