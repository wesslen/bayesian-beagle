### Major Findings

1. **SleIcl Method**: The paper introduces a method called SleIcl for enhancing the performance of weak language models by utilizing strong language models to learn from representative samples and distill skills for solving specific tasks, known as grimoire.

2. **Grimoire Types**: The paper explores four representative sample selection methods and a zero-shot approach, alongside two grimoire generation templates, resulting in the creation of 10 types of single grimoires.

3. **Performance Improvement**: The study demonstrates that the SleIcl method substantially enhances the performance of weak language models with varying parameter sizes on diverse tasks, with smaller models exhibiting more pronounced improvements. On certain datasets, weak language models, with the aid of the method, outperformed GPT4-1106-preview in zero-shot scenarios.

### Related Works
- **In-context Learning of Large Language Model**: The paper discusses the significance of In-context Learning (ICL) in enhancing the performance of large language models on specific tasks. It emphasizes the importance of data structure and the influence of contextual learning on the model's latent concepts and specific functions.

- **Prompt Engineering of Demo Examples**: The construction and ordering of demonstration examples significantly impact ICL performance. The study explores the characteristics, ordering, and selection strategies of demonstration examples.

### Critique
The paper provides a comprehensive exploration of the SleIcl method and its applicability in enhancing the performance of weak language models. However, it could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the potential limitations or challenges in implementing the proposed SleIcl method. Additionally, concrete examples or case studies showcasing the real-world application of the SleIcl method would enhance the practical understanding of its effectiveness.
