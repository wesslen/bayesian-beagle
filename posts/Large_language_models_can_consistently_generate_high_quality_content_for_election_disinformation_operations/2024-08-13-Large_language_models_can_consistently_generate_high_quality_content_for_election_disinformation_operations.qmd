**Summary:**

The rise of generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) has the potential to supercharge existing information operations and allow new ones to enter the arena. These models can roleplay as different personas and reproduce granular details about specific individuals, concepts, and places, lending themselves to the creation of more authentic content in information operations. However, it remains to be seen how effective this style of operations is, as work is done after training LLMs to align them with human values and prevent harm or misuse.

**Major Findings:**

1. LLMs can comply with instructions to generate content for an election disinformation operation, with models that do refuse also refusing benign election prompts and prompts to write from a right-wing perspective.
2. Human participants are unable to discern LLM-generated and human-written content over 50% of the time for most models released since 2022, even in highly localized geographic contexts.
3. Two models achieve above-human-humanness on average, meaning they are perceived as more human-like than human-written content.

**Analysis and Critique:**

While LLMs can generate realistic content at scale, there are potential problems and shortcomings that need to be addressed. One major concern is the potential for LLMs to be used in disinformation operations, as they can generate content that is indistinguishable from human-written content. This raises ethical concerns about the use of LLMs in spreading false or misleading information. Additionally, there is a risk that LLMs could be used to generate content that is harmful or offensive, as they may not be able to fully understand the context or implications of the content they generate.

Another concern is the potential for LLMs to perpetuate biases or stereotypes, as they are trained on large datasets that may contain biased or inaccurate information. This could lead to the generation of content that reinforces harmful stereotypes or perpetuates discrimination.

Finally, there is a risk that LLMs could be used to generate content that is not aligned with human values or ethical principles. This could occur if LLMs are not properly aligned with human values during the training process, or if they are used in ways that are not consistent with ethical principles.

To address these concerns, it
