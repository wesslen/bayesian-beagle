### Summary:

- The paper investigates the trade-off between efficiency, performance, and adversarial robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) by comparing three prominent models: Transformer++, Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformer, and MatMul-Free LM.
- The study utilizes the GLUE and AdvGLUE datasets, with the latter extending the GLUE dataset with adversarial samples designed to challenge model robustness.
- The results show that while the GLA Transformer and MatMul-Free LM achieve slightly lower accuracy on GLUE tasks, they demonstrate higher efficiency and either superior or comparative robustness on AdvGLUE tasks compared to Transformer++ across different attack levels.
- The findings highlight the potential of simplified architectures to achieve a compelling balance between efficiency, performance, and adversarial robustness, offering valuable insights for applications where resource constraints and resilience to adversarial attacks are critical.

### Major Findings:

1. The GLA Transformer and MatMul-Free LM achieve higher efficiency and comparative performances compared to Transformer++ across GLUE tasks.
2. GLA Transformer demonstrates superior robustness across all attack levels, while MatMul-Free LM is more robust to word-level attacks and equally robust to sentence-level and human-level attacks as Transformer++.
3. The study bridges the research gap on the adversarial robustness of attention-efficient models, such as GLA Transformer and MatMul-Free LM, by assessing their resilience under different types of adversarial attacks.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The paper provides a valuable framework for assessing the trade-offs between computational efficiency, performance, and adversarial robustness of LLMs with varying complexity.
- The study focuses on three specific models and does not explore the trade-offs in other LLMs, which could limit the generalizability of the findings.
- The paper does not discuss the potential impact of model size on the trade-offs between efficiency, performance, and adversarial robustness.
- The study does not consider the potential impact of different training strategies or hyperparameter tuning on the trade-offs between efficiency, performance, and adversarial robustness.
- The paper does not
