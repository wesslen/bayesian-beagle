### **Summary:**

- Large Language Model (LLM) systems are inherently compositional, with individual LLMs serving as the core foundation with additional layers of objects such as plugins, sandbox, etc.
- Existing studies on LLM security often focus on individual LLMs but without examining the ecosystem through the lens of LLM systems with other objects.
- A new information-flow-based formulation is proposed to systematically analyze the security of LLM systems, focusing on the unique probabilistic nature of LLM and formulating security as constraints on the alignment of information flow within LLM and between LLM and other objects.
- The security issues in the state-of-the-art LLM system, OpenAI GPT4, are investigated, exposing several security issues not just within the LLM model itself but also in its integration with other components.

### Major Findings:
1. **LLM System Security Formulation
