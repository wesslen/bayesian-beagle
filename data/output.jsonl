Two dedicated evaluation tasks are proposed: version-specific code completion (VSCC) and version-aware code editing (VACE). Comprehensive experiments are conducted to benchmark the performance of LLMs, revealing the challenging nature of these tasks and the struggle of even state-of-the-art LLMs to generate version-correct code.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1.

The study uses a synthetic dataset with seven representative OCKR tasks to evaluate the LLaMA2-13B-chat model. The results show that the model's proficiency in OCKR is limited, regardless of whether the knowledge is trained in separate or adjacent settings. Training the model to reason with complete reasoning data did not result in significant improvement. However, training the model to perform explicit knowledge retrieval helped in only one of the tasks, indicating that the model's limited OCKR capabilities are due to difficulties in retrieving relevant knowledge. The study also evaluates the model's ability to transfer knowledge across languages and finds that it exhibits limited ability in this area as well.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The LLaMA2-13B-chat model shows limited OCKR ability, even with knowledge occurring adjacently during training.\n2. Training the model with reasoning examples does not lead to significant improvement, suggesting that enhancing reasoning ability in general is insufficient for effective OCKR.\n3. With the help of CoT, the model achieves over 90% accuracy in one task but does not surpass the random level in other two tasks. This indicates that the model can effectively retrieve attribute knowledge but struggles with correctly retrieving relational knowledge, which might be a limiting factor in OCKR.\n4. In both the Separate and Adjacent settings, the performance in cross-lingual scenarios surpasses that of the monolingual, but the overall performance is still weak.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the OCKR capabilities of LLMs, highlighting their limitations in this area. However, the study is limited to a few selected models, with the largest model being only 13B parameters. This limitation prevents the assessment of the capabilities of more advanced models, such as GPT-4.

The models are tasked with assigning relevance scores to each pair, which are then compared to those from human annotators to evaluate inter-annotator agreement levels. The results reveal that LLMs can be used in low-resource language scenarios to automate relevance judgment tasks, with an inter-annotator agreement of Cohen\u2019s kappa score of 0.2634 when evaluated using the 70B variant of the LLaMA3 model.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1.

The method is evaluated using the real-world closed-loop motion planning nuPlan benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the LLM planner in a real-world setting.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. InstructDriver aligns LLMs with human driving behavior by generating a series of instructions based on human driving logic.\n2.

Fine-tuned DARA achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with both ICL-based and other fine-tuned agents (AgentLMs and fine-tuned AgentBench) across the three important benchmarks in zero-shot evaluation. Moreover, training with 768 reasoning trajectories, DARA can achieve highly competitive performances comparable to enumerating-and-ranking-based models trained on larger data.\n3. The ongoing challenge of generating high-quality reasoning trajectories for language agents in KGQA with GPT-4 has been revealed.

{"id": "2406.06870v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe article discusses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) and suggests integrating them with an \"algebraic\" representation of knowledge, including symbolic AI elements used in expert systems, to create Large Knowledge Models (LKMs). This integration aims to create models that not only possess \"deep\" knowledge grounded in first principles but also have the ability to reason and explain, mimicking human expert capabilities.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. LLMs, such as GPT-3.5, use high-dimensional vectors for embedding tokens, which raises the question of whether they use a \"geometric\" representation rather than an \"algebraic\" one for their knowledge internally.\n2. The performance of LLMs critically depends on the quantity and quality of data used in their training. As the LLM has more parameters and is trained on more data, its problem-solving capability grows enormously.\n3. Recent research from Anthropic AI and Open AI reveals that LLMs, such as Claude 3 Sonnet, use a \"geometry\"-like internal representation in a high-dimensional embedding space rather than an \"algebraic\" one. This representation captures the meanings of words and phrases and their relative distances, making it easier to do sophisticated \"reasoning,\" such as analogies and metaphors.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n1. The article suggests that relying only on a \"geometric\" understanding of the world limits the potential of LLMs, particularly for science and engineering applications.\n2. The authors argue that current LLMs have achieved animal-like mastery of their tasks but not a \"deeper\" mechanistic understanding of the world, as humans do.\n3. The article highlights the need for LLMs to evolve beyond their current capabilities and incorporate both \"algebraic\" (i.e., symbolic) and \"geometric\" representations of the world, particularly for science and engineering.\n4. The authors propose the development of hybrid AI systems, called Large Knowledge Models (LKMs), which would not be limited to NLP-based techniques or NLP-like applications only.\n5.

This research aims to identify ethical considerations that arise in the design and development of these two technologies in combination. Using LLMs for social robotics may provide benefits, such as enabling natural language open-domain dialogues. However, the intersection of these two technologies also gives rise to ethical concerns related to misinformation, non-verbal cues, emotional disruption, and biases. The robot\u2019s physical social embodiment adds complexity, as ethical hazards associated with LLM-based Social AI, such as hallucinations and misinformation, can be exacerbated due to the effects of physical embodiment on social perception and communication. To address these challenges, this study employs an empirical design justice-based methodology, focusing on identifying socio-technical ethical considerations through a qualitative co-design and interaction study. The purpose of the study is to identify ethical considerations relevant to the process of co-design of, and interaction with a humanoid social robot as the interface of a LLM, and to evaluate how a design justice methodology can be used in the context of designing LLMs-based social robotics.\n\n**Major Findings:**\n\n1.

The study also considers critical barriers to implementing GPTs at each step of the supply chain and proposes initial measures to overcome these obstacles.\n\n**Major Findings:**\n\n1. LLMs, such as GPTs, can be integrated into training modules for farm workers to explain the lifecycle and transmission pathways of Campylobacter in poultry farms. They can also simulate interactive scenarios where workers must choose the best practices to prevent contamination at rearing.\n2. LLMs can provide customized summaries of HACCP and GHP guidelines that are most relevant to a specific farm's operations. They can emphasize specific control points like chilling during processing, where Campylobacter is most likely to spread, and generate step-by-step checklists for daily, weekly, and monthly hygiene practices tailored to the scale and specific setup of the farm.\n3. LLMs can serve as a real-time advisory tool, a conversational \"digital poultry advisor,\" assisting poultry farm workers in making informed decisions when unexpected situations arise. For instance, if a section of a poultry farm reports a sudden increase in temperature or a breakdown in equipment used for processing, the LLM can suggest immediate actions to mitigate any potential increase in Campylobacter risk due to these changes.\n\n**Analysis and Critique:**\n\nThe study presents an intriguing potential for LLMs to enhance food safety, but the 'LLM \u2013 food safety' interface remains largely underexplored.

{"id": "2406.06822v1", "text": "**Summary:**\n\nThe paper introduces CodeBreaker, a pioneering LLM-assisted backdoor attack framework on code completion models. Unlike recent attacks that embed malicious payloads in detectable or irrelevant sections of the code, CodeBreaker leverages LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for sophisticated payload transformation, ensuring that both the poisoned data for fine-tuning and generated code can evade strong vulnerability detection. CodeBreaker stands out with its comprehensive coverage of vulnerabilities, making it the first to provide such an extensive set for evaluation.\n\n**Major Findings:**\n\n1. CodeBreaker is the first LLM-assisted backdoor attack on code completion against strong vulnerability detection, ensuring that both the poisoned data (for fine-tuning) and the generated insecure suggestions (during inferences) are undetectable by static analysis tools.\n2. CodeBreaker can bypass the LLMs-based vulnerability detection, which has been empirically shown to be more powerful than static analyses.\n3. CodeBreaker injects malicious payloads in the code, ensuring that the attack can be launched even if comments are not loaded for fine-tuning. It is also designed for easy activation and can be effectively triggered by any code or string triggers.\n4. CodeBreaker aims to minimize the code transformation for better stealthiness and provides a novel framework to tune the stealthiness and evasion performance per their tradeoff.\n5. CodeBreaker takes the first cut to analyze static analysis rules for 247 vulnerabilities, categorizing them into dataflow analysis, string matching, and constant analysis. It also considers text trigger and different code triggers in its attack settings.\n\n**Analysis and Critique:**\n\nWhile CodeBreaker presents a significant advancement in backdoor attacks on code completion models, there are potential limitations and areas for improvement. The reliance on LLMs for payload transformation and obfuscation may introduce new vulnerabilities in the LLMs themselves, as they are used to facilitate adversarial attacks.

{"id": "2406.06737v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe Raccoon benchmark is a novel evaluation framework designed to assess the vulnerability of LLM-integrated applications to prompt theft. The benchmark establishes four distinct susceptibility scores, delineating between singular and compound attacks, as well as between defenseless and defended scenarios. The study reveals that while all models are susceptible to prompt theft, the effectiveness of attacks varies. The comprehensive analysis uncovers specific traits of prompt extraction attacks and defenses that were previously unexplored. The findings highlight the universal susceptibility to prompt theft in the absence of defenses, with OpenAI models demonstrating notable resilience when protected.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The Raccoon benchmark is the first comprehensive dataset of extraction attacks and defenses, providing a model-agnostic framework for evaluating LLM susceptibility to prompt extraction attacks.\n2. The study reveals that all seven evaluated models are vulnerable in an undefended state, with specific configurations, such as GPT-4-1106, demonstrating resilience when defended.\n3. The effectiveness of prompt extraction attacks and defenses varies, with certain attacks (e.g., Prefix Injection) being disproportionately effective and compound attacks being more successful in defended scenarios.\n4. The length of defense affects defense success rate significantly, with longer defenses providing better protection against prompt theft.\n5. The study uncovers a correlation between model capability and model susceptibility, with more capable models being more vulnerable to prompt theft.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe Raccoon benchmark provides a valuable resource for the research community to evaluate and enhance model robustness against prompt theft. However, the study has some limitations. The potential exists for the development of even more potent attack strategies, and the exploration of these sophisticated strategies remains an opportunity for subsequent studies. Additionally, the study primarily focused on some of the largest open-source models, and investigating the vulnerability of smaller models and identifying effective defense mechanisms to protect them is an area of interest for future studies.\n\nThe study also raises ethical concerns, as the findings could be misused by malicious entities.

Over 2000 students made over 100,000 requests of the bot across two semesters. The assistant offers one-shot, contextual feedback through a \"Get Help\" button in a popular code editor and a \"get feedback\" feature within an autograder. The bot identifies the assignment and collects student code, wrapping it in a custom prompt to support pedagogical goals and avoid providing direct solutions. The paper reports on the development process, deployment, and analysis of possible impacts on students, primarily through student feedback and homework completion times.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. **Reduction in homework completion time**: The study found substantial reductions in homework completion time, with the most pronounced effects for students in the 75th percentile, with reductions of over 30 minutes.\n2. **No clear transfer of effects to other contexts**: It is not clear that these effects transfer to assignment contexts where the Bot is not available. Some contexts showed speedups, while others showed no change or even a slowdown.\n3. **Potential over-reliance or dependency effect**: There is weak evidence of a potential over-reliance or dependency effect, with performance degradation on bot-never-available labs and students reporting that labs take much longer than they would if the bot were available.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits and drawbacks of using an AI-based homework assistant in a large CS1 course. The reduction in homework completion time is a significant finding, as it suggests that the bot can help students complete their work more efficiently. However, the lack of clear transfer of these effects to other contexts and the potential over-reliance or dependency effect raise important questions about the bot's overall impact on student learning.\n\nFurther research is needed to disentangle these effects and better understand the bot's role in student learning.

PaCE aims to address the challenges of existing alignment methods, such as costly fine-tuning, inadequate removal of undesirable concepts, and harming linguistic capabilities. The framework consists of two stages: (1) Concept Construction and Partition, and (2) Activation Decomposition and Intervention.\n\nPaCE constructs a large-scale concept dictionary in the activation space, where each atom corresponds to a semantic concept. Given an alignment task, a concept partitioner efficiently annotates the concepts as benign or undesirable. At inference time, PaCE decomposes the LLM activations along the concept dictionary via sparse coding to accurately represent the activation as a linear combination of benign and undesirable components. By removing the latter ones from the activation, PaCE reorients the behavior of LLMs towards alignment goals.\n\nThe paper demonstrates that PaCE achieves state-of-the-art alignment performance on tasks such as response detoxification, faithfulness enhancement, and sentiment revising, while maintaining linguistic capabilities. The collected dataset for concept representations is available at <https://github.com/peterljq/Parsimonious-Concept-Engineering>.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1.

Instead, they argue that measurable semantic characteristics of LLM confabulations mirror a human propensity to utilize increased narrativity as a cognitive resource for sense-making and communication.\n\nThe authors analyze popular hallucination benchmarks and reveal that hallucinated outputs display increased levels of narrativity and semantic coherence relative to veridical outputs.

{"id": "2406.03636v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe paper presents a novel method called Synthetic Programming Elicitation and Compilation (SPEAC) for generating syntactically correct code from Large Language Models (LLMs) in very low resource programming languages (VLPLs). The approach is fundamentally different from existing prompting, decoding, and fine-tuning strategies. It is inspired by natural programming elicitation, a technique used to help programming language designers understand how programmers naturally approach problems.\n\nThe key idea behind SPEAC is to design an intermediate language that LLMs naturally know how to use and can be automatically compiled to the target VLPL. The paper introduces a case study using Python as the parent language, UCLID5 as the target language, and a subset of Python as the child language. UCLID5 is a language used for formal modeling and verification of state transition systems, which has limited code examples and is not frequently found in other programming languages.\n\nThe paper demonstrates that SPEAC produces syntactically correct programs more frequently than existing retrieval and fine-tuning baselines without sacrificing semantic correctness. The approach uses deductive techniques to automatically repair programs generated by LLMs that are in the child language but not in the target VLPL. When these deductive techniques are unable to fully repair a program, a hole is inserted, and an LLM is asked to finish the repair, repeating as necessary.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1.

The framework processes the entire input by interleaving reading and reasoning, and mitigates long context focus issues by assigning each agent a short context. Comprehensive evaluation on a wide range of long-context tasks in question answering, summarization, and code completion demonstrates significant improvements over strong baselines of RAG, Full-Context, and multi-agent LLMs.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. CoA is a training-free, task-agnostic, and highly interpretable framework that processes the entire input by interleaving reading and reasoning, and mitigates long context focus issues by assigning each agent a short context.\n2.

One limitation is that CoA does not explore other forms of communication approaches, such as debating or complex discussions.

However, the understanding of their inner workings is still limited. This study investigates the conventional wisdom that preference learning trains models to assign higher likelihoods to more preferred outputs than less preferred outputs, measured via ranking accuracy. Surprisingly, most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 70% on common preference datasets. The study further derives the idealized ranking accuracy that a preference-tuned LLM would achieve if it optimized the DPO or RLHF objective perfectly. The results show that existing models exhibit a significant alignment gap \u2013 a gap between the observed and idealized ranking accuracies. This discrepancy is attributed to the DPO objective, which is empirically and theoretically ill-suited to fix even mild ranking errors in the reference model.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 70% on common preference datasets.\n2.

The study aims to reassess the need for large language models in sequential recommendation and investigate the effects of reducing the number of parameters during training and inference stages.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The authors discover that most intermediate layers of LLMs are redundant, which motivates them to empower small language models for sequential recommendation (SLMRec) using a simple yet effective knowledge distillation method.\n2. SLMRec attains the best performance using only 13% of the parameters found in LLM-based recommendation models, while simultaneously achieving up to 6.6x and 8.0x speedups in training and inference time costs, respectively.\n3. The proposed SLMRec model, with a model size of less than 1 billion parameters, can deliver performance that is remarkably competitive with baselines using LLMs sized over 7 billion parameters.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n1.

The authors demonstrate that frontier LLMs can perform inductive OOCR, as evidenced by a suite of five tasks. In one experiment, an LLM was finetuned on a corpus consisting only of distances between an unknown city and other known cities. Remarkably, the LLM could verbalize that the unknown city is Paris and use this fact to answer downstream questions without in-context learning or Chain of Thought. Further experiments showed that LLMs trained only on individual coin flip outcomes could verbalize whether the coin is biased, and those trained only on pairs could articulate a definition of a function and compute inverses. However, OOCR was found to be unreliable, particularly for smaller LLMs learning complex structures. The ability of LLMs to \"connect the dots\" without explicit in-context learning poses a potential obstacle to monitoring and controlling the knowledge acquired by LLMs.\n\n**Major Findings:**\n\n1. Frontier LLMs can perform inductive OOCR, inferring latent information from evidence distributed across training documents and applying it to downstream tasks without in-context learning.\n2.

PostMark does not require access to the underlying model's logits, unlike most existing watermarking algorithms. The method is based on the intuition that a text's semantics should not drastically change after watermarking or paraphrasing. PostMark uses an embedding model, a secret word embedding table, and an insertion model implemented via an instruction-following LLM. The paper presents extensive experiments across eight baseline algorithms, five base LLMs, and three datasets, demonstrating that PostMark offers superior robustness to paraphrasing attacks compared to existing methods.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. PostMark consistently achieves a high true positive rate (TPR) before paraphrasing and maintains a higher TPR after paraphrasing compared to other baselines, including Blackbox, the only other method that operates under the same logit-free condition.\n2. PostMark is more robust than the three baselines that also condition on input semantics: SemStamp, k-SemStamp, and SIR.\n3. Logit-based baselines perform worse on low-entropy models and tasks, while PostMark stays relatively unaffected.\n4. An open-weight combination of Llama-3-70B-Inst and nomic-embed can also achieve promising robustness to paraphrasing attacks, showcasing the modular design of PostMark.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n1.

The benchmark is designed to probe the models' temporal reasoning skills, with all questions human-annotated according to a carefully constructed ability taxonomy.\n3. MMBench-Video employs GPT-4 for automated assessment, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness over earlier LLM-based evaluations.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n1. While MMBench-Video offers a more comprehensive evaluation of LVLMs, it may not encompass every video topic and fine-grained capability, potentially limiting its ability to reflect the video understanding capabilities of VLMs in specific tasks or scenarios.\n2. The use of GPT-4 for automated assessment, while demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness, may introduce biases or limitations inherent in the model's design and training data.\n3. The benchmark's reliance on YouTube videos may limit its generalizability to other video platforms or types of video content.\n4. The benchmark's focus on temporal reasoning skills may overlook other important aspects of video understanding, such as spatial reasoning or object recognition.\n5. The benchmark's use of free-form questions may introduce variability in the difficulty and complexity of the questions, potentially affecting the reliability and validity of the evaluation.\n6.

The authors perform ablations to understand why and how this additional training signal helps in model distillation. They report some potentially surprising results:\n\n1. Placing CoT sequences after labels (rather than before) results in better downstream performance. This means that no student \"reasoning\" is necessary at test time to realize gains.\n2. When rationales are appended in this way, they need not be coherent reasoning sequences to yield improvements. Performance increases are robust to permutations of CoT tokens.\n3. A small number of key tokens are sufficient to achieve improvements equivalent to those observed when full rationales are used in model distillation.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. CoT-augmented distillation works better when rationales are provided after labels. Standard CoT reasoning elicited zero-shot from massive LMs yields rationales as prefixes that logically lead to the label tokens. However, smaller models perform consistently better when rationales follow labels in distillation targets.\n2. When appended to target labels, token-level order, length, and coherence of rationales does not matter. However, these things do matter when rationales are preprended. When the rationales are placed before the final label during fine-tuning, masking, shuffling, or altering coherent rationales significantly degrades model performance.\n3. Motivated by the preceding observations, the authors run controlled experiments to establish that there are certain key, contextual tokens that connect the input to the final label, and appending these tokens to labels is sufficient to achieve performance on-par with coherent CoT-like rationales. It is solely the presence of these tokens at training time that leads to downstream performance improvements.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n* The paper provides valuable insights into the role of CoT reasoning in model distillation, highlighting the importance of the position of rationales and the presence of key tokens.\n* The findings challenge the assumption that student models benefit from learning to mimic the relevant \"reasoning\"", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14511v1.pdf", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2406.14511v1", "abs": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14511v1"}, "authors": "Somin Wadhwa, Silvio Amir, Byron C.

The authors generated 720 persuasive messages on 10 U.S. political issues using 24 language models of varying sizes. They then deployed these messages in a large-scale randomized survey experiment to estimate the persuasive capability of each model. The findings reveal a log scaling law, where model persuasiveness is characterized by sharply diminishing returns. This means that current frontier models are barely more persuasive than models smaller in size by an order of magnitude or more.

These findings suggest that further scaling model size will not significantly increase the persuasiveness of static LLM-generated messages.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The persuasiveness of language models follows a log scaling law, with sharply diminishing returns as model size increases.\n2.

The authors argue that previous research suggesting grounding objectives reduce hallucination is not empirically justified, as it relies on flawed evaluation protocols. The current study offers a systematic analysis of the effect of fine-grained object grounding on LVLM hallucination under a more realistic evaluation protocol. The results of extensive experiments over three backbone LLMs reveal that grounding objectives have little to no effect on object hallucination in open caption generation.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The study finds that under a sound evaluation protocol, including grounding objectives\u2014referring expressions and grounded captioning\u2014to LVLM training has little to no effect on object hallucination, both in QA-based evaluation and open-ended captioning.\n2. Enforcing generation of grounded captions at inference time slightly reduces object hallucinations but the effect is small and comes at the cost of (slight) reduction in caption detailedness.\n3. A qualitative inspection of grounded captions also confirms that forcing the model to generate a bounding box for mentioned objects most often does not prevent it from hallucinating content.\n4.

Q* aims to alleviate the pathology of LLMs, which are prone to produce errors, hallucinations, and inconsistent statements when performing multi-step reasoning due to their auto-regressive nature. By learning a plug-and-play Q-value model as a heuristic function, Q* can effectively guide LLMs to select the most promising next step without fine-tuning LLMs for each task, avoiding significant computational overhead and potential performance degeneration on other tasks.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Q* formalizes the multi-step reasoning of LLMs as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the state is the input prompt and the reasoning steps generated so far, the action is the next step of reasoning, and the reward measures how well the task is solved.\n2. The paper presents several general approaches to estimate the optimal Q-value of state-action pairs, including offline reinforcement learning, best sequence from rollout, and completion with stronger LLMs. These methods only need the ground truth of training problems and can be easily applied to various reasoning tasks without modification.\n3. Q* casts solving multi-step reasoning tasks as a heuristic search problem, where the objective is to find the most proper reasoning trace with maximum utility. Built upon A* search, Q* leverages plug-and-play Q-value models as a heuristic function and guides LLMs to select the most promising next reasoning step in a best-first fashion.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nWhile Q* demonstrates promising results in improving the multi-step reasoning capability of LLMs, there are some potential limitations and areas for further research.\n\n1.

Furthermore, the paper demonstrates an application of safety neurons in detecting unsafe outputs before generation, improving model safety by refusing to respond when harmful content is detected.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Safety neurons are sparse and effective, with intervention on about 5% of all neurons restoring up to 90% of safety performance.\n2. Safety neurons encode transferable mechanisms, exhibiting consistent effectiveness on different red-teaming datasets.\n3. The findings of safety neurons interpret the \"alignment tax,\" which refers to the trade-off between harmlessness and helpfulness in LLMs.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe paper provides a novel approach to understanding the inner workings of safety alignment in LLMs by identifying and analyzing safety neurons. The proposed methods, generation-time activation contrasting and dynamic activation patching, offer valuable insights into the causal effects of these neurons on safety behaviors. However, the paper does not address potential limitations or biases in the methodology, such as the generalizability of the findings to other LLMs or the impact of different model architectures on the results.

These challenges include limited prompt length, unstructured item information, and unconstrained generation of recommendations. The TaxRec approach uses a taxonomy dictionary to categorize and organize items, improving the clarity and structure of item information. By incorporating the taxonomy dictionary into LLM prompts, the method achieves efficient token utilization and controlled feature generation, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant recommendations. The approach features a two-step process: one-time taxonomy categorization and LLM-based recommendation, enabling zero-shot recommendations without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that TaxRec significantly enhances recommendation quality compared to traditional zero-shot approaches.\n\n## Major Findings:\n1. The use of a taxonomy dictionary provides a systematic framework for categorizing and organizing items, enhancing the structure and clarity of item information.\n2.

The authors propose three attack methods inspired by cognitive and social psychology principles: Disguise, Deception, and Teaching. These methods are used to build evaluation datasets for four common bias types: age, gender, race, and sex orientation. The study finds that all three attack methods effectively elicit LLMs' inner bias, with Deception attacks being the most effective. The results also show that GLM-3 performs the best in defending against these attacks, compared to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The study further reveals that LLMs could output content of other bias types when being taught with one type of bias.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. All three attack methods (Disguise, Deception, and Teaching) can successfully elicit LLMs' inner bias, with Deception attacks being the most effective.\n2. Regarding bias performance, the ranking from less to more is GLM-3, GPT-4, and GPT-3.5, probably due to the stricter regulation of LLMs in China.\n3. The LLMs have demonstrated less bias in the bias types that draw more social attention, e.g., gender and race.\n4. Notably, when Teaching attacks provide LLMs with one type of bias examples (e.g., race), other types of bias can be elicited (gender, religion) from LLMs, showing the inherent bias in the models.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe paper provides a novel and rigorous approach to evaluating implicit bias in LLMs. The use of psychometric principles to design attack methods is a significant contribution to the field. However, the study has some limitations. The evaluation data is adapted from four important bias categories of the CBBQ dataset, which is a bias dataset extracted from Chinese corpora.

Unlike existing outcome-based benchmarks, Mr-Ben focuses on the process of reasoning, demanding a meta-reasoning skill from LLMs. The benchmark comprises 5,975 questions collected from human experts, covering various subjects such as physics, chemistry, logic, coding, and more.\n\n## Major Findings:\n\n1. Mr-Ben is a comprehensive benchmark that employs a meta-reasoning paradigm, where LLMs are challenged to reason about different forms of reasoning. This paradigm involves LLMs acting as teachers, evaluating the reasoning process by assessing correctness, analyzing potential errors, and providing corrections.\n\n2. The analyses of various LLMs on Mr-Ben reveal distinct limitations and previously unidentified weaknesses in their reasoning abilities. While many LLMs can generate the correct answer to a question, they struggle to pinpoint errors in the reasoning process and correct them. This suggests that existing LLMs have yet to master reasoning, particularly the smaller models.\n\n3. Techniques such as the use of high-quality synthetic data can significantly improve reasoning abilities, offering a potential pathway to enhance performance regardless of model size. However, different LLMs excel in different reasoning paradigms, challenging the assumption that domain-specific enhancements necessarily lead to broad cognitive improvements.\n\n## Analysis and Critique:\n\nWhile Mr-Ben provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' reasoning abilities, it has some limitations. The benchmark's applicability may be restricted when it comes to subjects that are inherently holistic or creative in nature, such as humanities or sociology. Additionally, Mr-Ben is currently confined to questions in English, which could potentially limit the scope of reasoning challenges that can be explored.

The framework is evaluated using TutorCode, a large-scale uncrawled benchmark consisting of 1,239 C++ defect codes and associated information. The study assesses the realistic repair capabilities of 12 prominent LLMs and demonstrates the significant difference in performance on HumanEval and TutorCode. The experimental results show that tutor guidance significantly improves the repair performance of LLMs, while failing test cases have a limited impact due to the lengthy prompt problem. To mitigate this issue, a strategy called MultiRegenerate is proposed, which repairs incorrect code through three distinct conversational sessions. Cref outperforms the baseline and T&S&F in terms of AVG-5 and RPSR metrics and yields superior AVG-5 and comparable RPSR results compared to MultiRegenerate. The study concludes that incorporating historical failing repairs can significantly enhance repair capabilities in LLMs by fully exploiting their conversational potential.

The authors start by discussing traditional CI techniques when variables of interest are assumed to be fully observed. They then provide an in-depth discussion of various CI strategies to handle latent variables, covering the tasks of causal effect estimation, mediation analysis, counterfactual reasoning, and causal discovery. The authors also generalize the discussion to graph data where interference among units may exist. Finally, they offer fresh aspects for further advancement of CI with latent variables, especially new opportunities in the era of large language models (LLMs).\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The lack of observation of important variables (e.g., confounders, mediators, exogenous variables) severely compromises the reliability of CI methods.\n2. Various consequences can be incurred if latent variables are carelessly handled, such as biased estimation of causal effects, incomplete understanding of causal mechanisms, and lack of individual-level causal consideration.\n3. Circumvention-based methods eschew direct modeling of latent variables, while inference-based methods explicitly model the latent variables based on the observations.\n4.

{"id": "2406.13662v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe paper introduces a novel method called ObscurePrompt for jailbreaking Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach is inspired by the fragile alignments observed in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. The method begins by constructing a base prompt that integrates well-known jailbreaking techniques and then utilizes powerful LLMs to obscure the original prompt through iterative transformations. The goal is to bolster the attack's robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ObscurePrompt substantially improves upon previous methods in terms of attack effectiveness and maintains efficacy against two prevalent defense mechanisms.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The paper introduces a novel and straightforward approach named ObscurePrompt to jailbreaking LLMs using obscure inputs. This method is training-free and operates in a black-box setting, meaning it does not require access to the internal architecture of the target LLMs.\n2. The observation about LLMs' fragile alignment on OOD data is a key finding. By visualizing the representations of different queries within the hidden states of LLMs, it was observed that OOD queries (i.e., obscure queries) can significantly weaken the ethical decision boundary.\n3. Comprehensive experiments are performed to validate the efficacy of the method, which demonstrates superior performance over existing baselines for both black-box and white-box attacks. Other key findings from the experiments include: (1) the number of integrated prompts significantly influences the attack success rate; (2) combining all types of jailbreak strategies does not necessarily result in the most effective attack; (3) the proposed method remains effective against mainstream defenses.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\n1. The paper provides a fresh perspective on jailbreaking LLMs by focusing on the use of obscure inputs. This approach addresses the inadequacies in current LLM safety measures against OOD data.\n2. The method is straightforward and does not require access to the internal parameters of the target LLMs, making it more practical and applicable than previous methods.\n3. The paper's reliance on specific and fixed prompt templates may limit its generalizability. Future research could explore more flexible and adaptable methods for generating obscure inputs.\n4.

They demonstrate that a small amount of potentially auxiliary data can 'jog' the memory of unlearned models, causing them to behave similarly to their pre-unlearning state. The authors formalize this unlearning-relearning pipeline for LLMs and conduct case studies on three popular unlearning benchmarks: WMDP, TOFU, and Who's Harry Potter (WHP). The results show that their relearning attack can successfully drive the model to output unlearned knowledge under various practical settings.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The targeted relearning attack is effective in recovering unlearned hazardous knowledge in the WMDP benchmark using public articles.\n2. The attack can also successfully relearn private information in the TOFU and WHP datasets when using a small and highly limited subset of unlearned data as the relearn set.\n3. The study reveals that evaluating query completions on the unlearned model alone may give a false sense of unlearning quality.\n4. The approach of using benign public information to finetune the unlearned model is surprisingly effective in recovering unlearned knowledge.\n5. The study motivates the exploration of unlearning heuristics beyond approximate, gradient-based optimization to produce more robust baselines for machine unlearning.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe authors' work provides valuable insights into the limitations of current unlearning methods and the potential for targeted relearning attacks. However, there are some areas that could benefit from further exploration:\n\n1. The study focuses on finetuning-based unlearning schemes, and it would be interesting to see if the proposed attack can be generalized to other unlearning approaches.\n2. The authors mention the need to study the relation between the relearn set and the queries used for evaluation, as the relearn set might contain direct answers to the evaluation queries. This aspect could be further investigated to ensure that relearning occurs due to triggering the memory of the approximately unlearned model, rather than simply learning the knowledge again from scratch.\n3.

Cross-lingual contamination can easily fool existing detection methods, but not the proposed generalization-based methods.\n2.

GAL-Rec significantly enhances the comprehension of collaborative semantics, improving recommendation performance.\n2.

{"id": "2406.12702v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe article introduces two paradoxes concerning jailbreak of foundation models: the impossibility of constructing a perfect jailbreak classifier and the inability of a weaker model to consistently detect whether a stronger model is jailbroken or not. The authors provide formal proofs for these paradoxes and a short case study on Llama and GPT4-o to demonstrate their findings. The article discusses the broader theoretical and practical repercussions of these results.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. **Impossibility of Perfect Jailbreak Classifiers**: The authors prove that it is impossible to construct a universal and perfect jailbreak classifier for any model, irrespective of its power and alignment. This is due to the lack of a fixed and deterministic definition of alignment, which makes it impossible to prevent any model from getting jailbroken.\n\n2. **Weaker Models Cannot Detect Jailbreaks in Stronger Models**: The authors show that weaker models cannot detect whether a stronger model is jailbroken or not. This is because there is a pareto-dominant relationship between two models, where one model performs better than the other in at least one capability. In such cases, the weaker model cannot confidently classify or encode the input, which implies it cannot classify both with high confidence.\n\n3. **Practical Repercussions**: The authors discuss the practical repercussions of these results on jailbreak research.

Snap consists of three key steps: 1) negative instruction generation, which utilizes GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 to build the forgetting set; 2) hard retaining data augmentation, which creates related instructions and their normal responses to build the retaining set; and 3) OT unlearning, which involves the Wasserstein regularization that enforces adequate change in weights from the initial parameters of the LLM. The framework is evaluated on various NLP benchmarks and demonstrates the ability to retain the original LLM capabilities while successfully unlearning the specified information.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The paper introduces the notion of negative instructions that are used to train LLMs to generate obliterated responses.\n2. The paper proposes Hard Retaining Data Augmentation and demonstrates that hard positives are effective for selective unlearning.\n3. The paper presents the novel Wasserstein Regularization that minimizes the change in parameters during instruction tuning.\n4. The paper successfully removes Peter Parker, as well as a set of other identities, from the LLM while retaining the original LLM capabilities.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe paper presents a promising approach to selectively unlearning information in LLMs using negative instructions. The use of hard retaining data augmentation and Wasserstein regularization are effective in retaining the original LLM performance while unlearning the specified information. However, the paper does not address the potential limitations of the framework, such as the scalability of the approach for larger LLMs or the impact of the unlearning process on the overall performance of the LLM.

On three tool-use benchmarks (m&m\u2019s, M3ToolEval, and API-Bank), CodeNav is competitive with tool-use without requiring arduous tool registration.\n4. The effect of library or tool description richness on code-use performance is studied.\n5.

{"id": "2406.12266v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThis work proposes a client-centered approach to assessing LLM (Large Language Model) therapists, called ClientCAST. The approach involves using LLMs to simulate clients, who then interact with LLM therapists and complete questionnaires about the interaction. The client-centered assessment results are derived from the completed questionnaires. Through experiments, it is found that LLMs can generally, though not perfectly, simulate clients, and they are able to distinguish high- and low-quality sessions by completing client-centered questionnaires. The work acknowledges that LLMs struggle to achieve perfect simulation and high levels of human trust in the short term, but argues that the imperfect simulation of LLMs can benefit humans in exploring specific tasks.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. LLMs can generally, though not perfectly, simulate clients, and they are able to distinguish high- and low-quality sessions by completing client-centered questionnaires.\n2. The performance of LLM therapists is significantly influenced by the underlying LLM, with more powerful LLMs achieving higher and more stable scores.\n3. LLM therapists can foster strong connections with clients, achieving comparable scores in terms of therapeutic alliance, but they are disadvantaged in reacting to clients\u2019 emotions, with lower scores in terms of positivity and smoothness compared to human therapists.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe proposed approach to assessing LLM therapists is a novel and promising direction for further analyses and studies. However, there are some limitations and ethical considerations to be aware of. One limitation is the inconsistency in the simulation of human behavior, which is observed in the field of counseling therapy. Neither the simulation of therapists nor clients is perfect, and LLMs face challenges in accurately simulating the personalities of human clients. However, more powerful LLMs can achieve higher simulation consistency and accuracy. Additionally, different LLMs exhibit inconsistency in various ways, which can be leveraged to simulate characters with diverse features.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, this work does not advocate for the use of LLMs in therapy, but rather proposes an assessment approach to reveal the characteristics of LLM therapists.

The authors propose the Instruction Vector (IV) framework to capture model representations highly related to specific instruction-following capabilities, making it possible to understand model-intrinsic forgetting. Through the analysis of IV dynamics pre and post-training, the authors suggest that fine-tuning mostly adds specialized reasoning patterns instead of erasing previous skills, which may appear as forgetting. The paper also introduces an IV-guided training method to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by preserving the original computation graph. Empirical tests on three benchmarks confirm the efficacy of this new approach.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. The paper introduces a new perspective on catastrophic forgetting by using Knowledge and Instruction Probability to evaluate how well LLMs retain task-specific knowledge and follow instructions after tuning, showing that changes in instruction adherence mainly drive performance declines.\n2. The authors are the first to interpret forgetting with the Instruction Vector framework, identifying inherent changes during fine-tuning. The findings indicate that fine-tuning generally introduces specialized reasoning patterns rather than removing existing skills.\n3.

The survey also summarizes some prevailing approaches to evaluate LLMs in terms of alignment with human intentions and discusses the outlooks on the human intention alignment for LLMs.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Human preference learning can effectively align LLMs with human intentions by optimizing LLMs according to feedback information on their outputs that reflects the preferences and thus specifies the intentions of humans.\n2. The quality and scale of preference feedback are of great importance for human preference learning, while the sources of feedback collection can heavily influence them.\n3. The feedback formats adopted in works on human preference learning broadly include relative relations that are natural for preference expression but less informative, and absolute properties that are more informative about human preferences but harder to collect.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe survey provides a comprehensive review of the development timeline and recent advances in human preference learning for LLMs. However, it does not discuss the limitations and challenges of human preference learning for LLMs. For instance, the survey does not address the issue of bias in human preference feedback, which can lead to biased LLMs. Additionally, the survey does not discuss the potential risks of using LLMs to simulate human feedback, such as the risk of overfitting to the feedback data.

The framework is designed to address the limitations of single-team collaboration, which can only execute all phases sequentially according to its pre-defined team configuration, leading to repetitive errors and preventing self-correction. CTC enables different teams to concurrently propose task-oriented decisions as insights for content generation (single-team proposal) and then communicate for insights interchange in some important phases (multi-team aggregation). The experimental results in software development reveal a notable increase in quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the efficacy of the framework. The significant improvements in story generation demonstrate the promising generalization ability of the framework across various domains.\n\n### Major Findings:\n\n1. Cross-team communication for insights interchange significantly improves software quality, indicating the effectiveness of multi-team task handling. It mainly contributes to an appropriate increase in the diversity and effective grouping of content.\n2. As the number of participating teams increases, the quality of software is subject to diminishing returns and may even deteriorate. In our study, this is primarily attributed to the increased probability of low-quality software with more teams, which adversely affects the aggregated software quality. The pruning mechanism we introduced effectively addresses this issue.\n3. Our CTC framework has the potential for development in broader content generation domains, including natural language generation and programming language generation.\n\n### Analysis and Critique:\n\nThe paper presents an innovative approach to multi-team collaboration for content generation, particularly in software development and story generation. The proposed framework, CTC, addresses the limitations of single-team collaboration by enabling multiple teams to work concurrently and communicate for insights interchange. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in improving software quality and story generation.\n\nHowever, the paper does not discuss the potential challenges and limitations of the CTC framework. For instance, managing the communication and coordination among multiple teams can be complex and resource-intensive. Additionally, the framework's scalability and adaptability to different domains and tasks need further investigation. The paper also does not provide a detailed comparison with other multi-", "meta": {"links": {"pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08979v1.pdf", "html": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2406.08979v1", "abs": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08979v1"}, "authors": "Zhuoyun Du, Chen Qian, Wei Liu, Zihao Xie, Yifei Wang, Yufan Dang, Weize Chen, Cheng Yang", "title": "Multi-Agent Software Development through Cross-Team Collaboration", "subtitle": "Cross-Team Collaboration (CTC) improves LLM-driven software development quality by exploring multiple decision paths.", "categories": ["programming"], "publish_date": "2024-06-13", "model": "accounts/fireworks/models/mixtral-8x22b-instruct", "temperature": 0.1, "image": "https://browse.arxiv.org/html/2406.08979v1/x1.png", "word_count": 8963, "extraction": "HTML", "is_truncated": false}}

The study established a taxonomy of both syntactic and semantic characteristics of code generation errors through open coding and thematic analysis.\n2. The authors analyzed the similarities and differences in errors made by different code generation models, highlighting the challenges faced by LLMs.\n3. The study discussed the implications and future opportunities for improving LLMs for code generation.\n4.

{"id": "2406.08477v1", "text": "### Summary:\n\nThe paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommendation systems, focusing on the tokenization of users and items. The authors argue that the use of in-vocabulary tokens, which are typically pretrained on natural language tasks, lack the expressive power for distinctive users and items, weakening the recommendation ability even after fine-tuning on recommendation tasks. To address this, the authors propose a framework that emphasizes the role of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens in addition to in-vocabulary ones. They claim that the memorization of OOV tokens captures correlations of users/items as well as diversity of OOV tokens. By clustering the learned representations from historical user-item interactions, the authors make the representations of user/item combinations share the same OOV tokens if they have similar properties. Integrating these OOV tokens into the LLM\u2019s vocabulary allows for better distinction between users and items and enhanced capture of user-item relationships during fine-tuning on downstream tasks.

Unlike traditional methods that rely on human-curated or pre-collected teacher responses, OPTune dynamically samples informative responses for on-policy preference alignment.
