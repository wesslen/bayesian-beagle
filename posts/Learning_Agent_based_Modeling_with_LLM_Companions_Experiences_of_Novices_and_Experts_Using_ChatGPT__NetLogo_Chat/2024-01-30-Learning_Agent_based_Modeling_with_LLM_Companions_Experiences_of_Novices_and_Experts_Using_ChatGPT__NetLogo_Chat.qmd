**Summary:**

- The study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting Agent-based modeling (ABM) in education and industry.
- NetLogo Chat, an LLM-based interface, was designed to support the learning and practice of NetLogo, a programming language for ABM.
- A qualitative study was conducted with 30 participants, including experts and novices, to understand their perceptions, behaviors, and needs when using LLM-based interfaces for NetLogo learning and practice.
- The study found significant differences between experts and novices in their perceptions, behaviors, and needs when using LLM-based interfaces for NetLogo learning and practice.
- Experts reported more perceived benefits than novices and were more inclined to adopt LLMs in their workflow.
- The study identified guidance, personalization, and integration as major needs for LLM-based interfaces to support the programming of ABM.

**Major Findings:**

1. Experts reported more perceived benefits than novices in using LLM-based interfaces for NetLogo learning and practice.
2. Experts and novices have different interaction patterns and needs when using LLM-based interfaces for NetLogo learning and practice.
3. LLMs can help learners overcome AI hallucinations, but novices struggle with evaluating and debugging AI responses.
4. Experts and novices have different needs in terms of guidance, personalization, and integration in LLM-based interfaces for ABM programming.

**Analysis and Critique:**

- The study's focus on NetLogo, a domain-specific programming language, limits the generalizability of the findings to other programming languages.
- The sample size of 30 participants may not be representative of the broader population of experts and novices in ABM and programming.
- The study did not control for the potential impact of participants' prior experience with NetLogo or other programming languages on their perceptions, behaviors, and needs when using LLM-based interfaces for NetLogo learning and practice.
- The study did not address the potential ethical implications of using LLMs in ABM programming, such as data privacy, bias, and accountability.
- The study did not explore the potential impact of LLMs on
