### **Summary:**

- The article introduces Controllable Preference Optimization (CPO), a method for multi-objective alignment in large language models (LLMs) that optimizes preferences for different objectives, such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness.
- CPO surpasses baseline methods in aligning with single objectives, thereby mitigating the impact of the "alignment tax" and achieving Pareto improvements in multi-objective alignment.
- The authors argue that controllability is key to multi-objective alignment, and propose to provide explicit preference conditions to ground LLMs for desirable behaviors.

### Major Findings:
1. CPO provides responses that match various preferences among the "3H" desiderata.
2. CPO outperforms baseline methods in aligning with single objectives, leading to improved multi-objective alignment.
3. Controllability is crucial for multi-objective alignment, and CPO enables the optimization of preferences for different objectives.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article does not provide a thorough comparison of CPO with other state-of-the-art multi-objective alignment techniques.
- The authors assume that users prioritize utility for problem-solving questions and moralities for controversial questions, which might not always be the case.
- The authors do not discuss potential biases introduced by the preference conditions, which could affect the model's behavior and performance.
- The experimental evaluation is limited to two datasets, and it would be beneficial to test CPO on a broader range of datasets and scenarios.
