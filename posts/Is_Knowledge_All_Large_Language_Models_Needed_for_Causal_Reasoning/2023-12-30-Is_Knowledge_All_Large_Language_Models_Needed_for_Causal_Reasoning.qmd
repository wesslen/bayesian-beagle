### Summary

#### Findings of the Paper

1. **Knowledge as the Principal Requirement**: The paper finds that **knowledge** is the primary requirement for sound causal reasoning in large language models (LLMs). LLMs demonstrate proficient causal reasoning when equipped with adequate knowledge, but their reliance on numerical data alone is limited.
   
2. **Causal Reasoning Ability**: The paper reveals that LLMs exhibit varying **causal reasoning abilities** across different domains, depending on the context and domain-specific knowledge provided.
   
3. **Influence of Input Components**: The study highlights the significance of **input components** such as variable names (knowledge) and numerical data in LLMs' causal reasoning processes. It outlines a method to attribute the contributions of these input components through causal attribution models.

#### Experiment Design

- **Causal Attribution Model**: The paper introduces a causal attribution model that quantifies the influence of knowledge and data on the accuracy of LLMs’ predictions in causal reasoning tasks. It defines conditional and marginal attributions of knowledge and data through the use of "do-operators" conceptualized by prior research.
   
- **Experiment Design**: The study carries out experiments to assess LLMs’ performance in causal reasoning by manipulating different input components, such as omitting knowledge, omitting data, and conducting reverse causal inference and pairwise causal discovery tasks. These experiments aim to evaluate LLMs’ reliance on contextual information and intrinsic knowledge.

#### Additional Insights

- **Supporting Analyses**: The paper provides additional analyses that delve into the computational skills of LLMs, the impact of variable order on causal reasoning, and the utilization of numerical data for causal inference.
   
- **Attribution Models for LLMs**: The paper contextualizes its approach within the field of **attribution models** for LLMs, emphasizing the importance of fair feature treatment and computational efficiency.

### Critique

The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of LLMs' causal reasoning abilities and the influence of input components on their performance. However, it could benefit from addressing the following potential limitations:

- **Generalizability**: The experiment design should include a more extensive range of LLMs and datasets to ensure the generalizability of the findings across different models and domains.
   
- **Model Transparency**: While the paper emphasizes the importance of interpretability in LLMs, it could further investigate the transparency of the developed causal attribution model and its applicability to other LLMs.

- **Practical Implications**: The paper could further delve into the practical implications of the findings, particularly in real-world applications of LLMs in causal reasoning tasks.

Overall, the paper presents significant insights into the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs and the contributions of knowledge and data to their performance, although further investigations and broader applicability are warranted.
