### Summary:

The research paper titled "New Curriculum, New Chance â€“ Retrieval Augmented Generation for Lesson Planning in Ugandan Secondary Schools: Prototype Quality Evaluation" by Simon Kloker, Herbertson Bukoli, and Twaha Kateete focuses on the development of a prototype software tool that generates lesson plans based on government-approved textbooks. The study aims to evaluate the quality of the generated lesson plans and their suitability for implementation in Ugandan classrooms.

The authors used Cohere LLM and Sentence Embeddings, and the LangChain Framework to create the prototype, which was made available on a public website. The prototype was trained on three new curriculum textbooks (ICT, Mathematics, and History) at the Secondary 1 Level. Twenty-four lesson plans were generated following a pseudo-random generation protocol based on the suggested periods in the textbooks. The lesson plans were analyzed regarding their technical quality by three independent raters using the Lesson Plan Analysis Protocol (LPAP) by Ndihokubwayo et al. (2022).

The evaluation of 24 lesson plans using the LPAP resulted in an average quality of between 75 and 80%, corresponding to "very good lesson plan." None of the lesson plans scored below 65%, although one lesson plan could be argued to have been missing the topic. The quality of the generated lesson plans is at least comparable, if not better, than those created by humans, as demonstrated in a study in Rwanda, where no lesson plan even reached the benchmark of 50%.

### Major Findings:

1. The prototype software tool generated lesson plans with an average quality of between 75 and 80%, corresponding to "very good lesson plan."
2. None of the lesson plans scored below 65%, although one lesson plan could be argued to have been missing the topic.
3. The quality of the generated lesson plans is at least comparable, if not better, than those created by humans, as demonstrated in a study in Rwanda, where no lesson plan even reached the benchmark of 50%.

### Analysis and Critique:

The study provides a promising approach to addressing the challenge of poor educational quality in Ugandan secondary schools, particularly in
