### **Summary:**
- Human learning is sensitive to rule-like structure and the curriculum of examples used for training.
- No neural model has simultaneously captured the seemingly contradictory effects of learning with rule-like structure and without it.
- The study shows that the tradeoff between blocking and interleaving spontaneously emerges with "in-context learning" (ICL) in neural networks trained with metalearning and in large language models (LLMs).

### Major Findings:
1. Human learning is sensitive to rule-like structure and the curriculum of examples used for training.
2. No neural model has simultaneously captured the seemingly contradictory effects of learning with rule-like structure and without it.
3. The study shows that the tradeoff between blocking and interleaving spontaneously emerges with "in-context learning" (ICL) in neural networks trained with metalearning and in large language models (LLMs).

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study provides a novel perspective on the curriculum effects observed in human learning, but it is based on the performance of neural networks and large language models, which may not fully capture the complexities of human cognition.
- The findings are consistent with previous neural network models, but the study does not address the potential limitations of using artificial intelligence models to explain human cognitive processes.
- The study emphasizes the emergent properties of an in-context learning algorithm in neural networks, but it does not fully address the biological and psychological plausibility of these models.
- The results offer insights into the interactions between in-context and in-weight learning, but further research is needed to validate these findings in real-world human learning environments.
