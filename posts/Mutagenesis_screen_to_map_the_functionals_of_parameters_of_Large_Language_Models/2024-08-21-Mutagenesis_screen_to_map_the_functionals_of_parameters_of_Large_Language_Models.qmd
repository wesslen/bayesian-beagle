### Summary:

The paper presents a mutagenesis screening approach to map the functionalities of parameters in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors draw inspiration from biological research methods and apply them to Llama2-7b and Zephyr LLMs. The study reveals intricate structures within both models at multiple levels, with phenotype maps of many matrices exhibiting a mix of maximum and minimum mutations. Notably, mutations that produce phenotypes, especially those with severe outcomes, tend to cluster along axes. The placement of maximum and minimum mutations typically follows a complementary pattern across the matrices in both models, with the Gate matrix demonstrating a unique two-dimensional asymmetry after rearrangement. In Zephyr, specific mutations consistently yield poetic or conversational outputs rather than descriptive ones. These "writer" mutations are categorized by the high-frequency initial word of the output, showing a significant tendency to share the same row coordinate across different matrices. The mutagenesis screen has also uncovered many other significant variations in the mutation maps of Llama2-7b and Zephyr, highlighting notable discrepancies in their structural and functional attributes.
