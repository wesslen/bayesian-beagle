### Summary:

The paper introduces a novel task of expert recommendation, which aims to identify trustworthy sources based on their previously quoted statements. The authors built a dataset, called NewsQuote, consisting of 23,571 quote-speaker pairs sourced from a collection of news articles. The recommendation task is formulated as the retrieval of experts based on their likelihood of being associated with a given query. The authors propose a multi-layer ranking framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the recommendation performance. The results show that employing an in-context learning based LLM ranker and a multi-layer ranking-based filter significantly improve both the predictive quality and behavioral quality of the recommender system.

### Major Findings:

1. The authors built a novel dataset, NewsQuote, consisting of 23,571 quote-speaker pairs sourced from a collection of news articles.
2. The recommendation task is formulated as the retrieval of experts based on their likelihood of being associated with a given query.
3. The authors propose a multi-layer ranking framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the recommendation performance.
4. The results show that employing an in-context learning based LLM ranker and a multi-layer ranking-based filter significantly improve both the predictive quality and behavioral quality of the recommender system.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents an interesting approach to expert recommendation using a multi-layer ranking framework with LLMs. The use of a novel dataset, NewsQuote, is a significant contribution to the field. However, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the performance of the proposed framework compared to existing methods. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed approach or potential biases in the dataset. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in real-world scenarios and to address any potential biases in the dataset.
