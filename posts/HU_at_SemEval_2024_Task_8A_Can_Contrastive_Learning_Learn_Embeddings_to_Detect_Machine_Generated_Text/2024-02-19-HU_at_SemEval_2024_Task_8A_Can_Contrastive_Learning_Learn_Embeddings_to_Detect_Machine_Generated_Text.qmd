### **Summary:**
- The paper describes a system developed for SemEval-2024 Task 8, focusing on detecting machine-generated text.
- It proposes a single model based on contrastive learning, which shows comparable performance with fewer parameters.
- The system addresses the challenge of detecting machine-generated text without relying on the specific text-generating model.

### Major Findings:
1. The proposed single model based on contrastive learning shows comparable performance with fewer parameters.
2. The system addresses the challenge of detecting machine-generated text without relying on the specific text-generating model.
3. The system ranked 21st out of 137 participants in the test dataset.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The paper provides valuable insights into the use of contrastive learning for detecting machine-generated text.
- The proposed system's performance is promising, but further exploration is needed to optimize hyperparameters and explore advanced contrastive loss functions.
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion of potential biases and limitations in the proposed system, which could be addressed in future research.
