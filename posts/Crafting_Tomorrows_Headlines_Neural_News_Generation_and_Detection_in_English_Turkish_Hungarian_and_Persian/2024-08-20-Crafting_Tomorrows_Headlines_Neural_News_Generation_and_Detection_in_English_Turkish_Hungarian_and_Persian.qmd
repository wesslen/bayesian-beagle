**Summary:**

The paper presents a benchmark dataset for neural news detection in four languages: English, Turkish, Hungarian, and Persian. The dataset includes outputs from multiple multilingual generators, such as BloomZ, LLaMa-2, Mistral, Mixtral, and GPT-4. The authors experiment with various classifiers, ranging from linguistic feature-based to advanced Transformer-based models and LLMs prompting. The main goal is to explore the interpretability and robustness of machine-generated text detectors across all target languages.

The paper also discusses the use of transformer-based baselines, BERT and RoBERTa, for fine-tuning and assessing the performance of each language separately in classifying news from humans vs. LLMs. The optimizer used for both models was adamw, with a learning rate of . The best validation losses for English, Turkish, Hungarian, and
