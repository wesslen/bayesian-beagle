### Summary:

The paper investigates the robustness of existing AI-generated text (AIGT) detection methods and introduces a novel detector, the Siamese Calibrated Reconstruction Network (SCRN). The SCRN employs a reconstruction network to add and remove noise from text, extracting a semantic representation that is robust to local perturbations. The paper also proposes a siamese calibration technique to train the model to make equally confidence predictions under different noise, which improves the model’s robustness against adversarial perturbations. Experiments on four publicly available datasets show that the SCRN outperforms all baseline methods, achieving 6.5%-18.25% absolute accuracy improvement over the best baseline method under adversarial attacks. Moreover, it exhibits superior generalizability in cross-domain, cross-genre, and mixed-source scenarios.

### Major Findings:

1. The SCRN outperforms all baseline methods in terms of robustness, achieving higher accuracy under adversarial perturbation attacks.
2. The SCRN improves over the best baseline method by 11.25, 18.25, 14.5, and 15.75 absolute points of accuracy under attack in in-domain, cross-domain, cross-genre, and mixed-source scenarios, respectively.
3. The SCRN employs a reconstruction network to add and remove noise from text, extracting a semantic representation that is robust to local perturbations.
4. The SCRN uses a siamese calibration technique to train the model to make equally confidence predictions under different noise, which improves the model’s robustness against adversarial perturbations.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel approach to AIGT detection that addresses the limitations of existing methods in terms of robustness against adversarial perturbations. The proposed SCRN model demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy and generalizability across different scenarios. However, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations or biases of the proposed method, such as the impact of the choice of noise distribution or the potential for overfitting to the training data. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the computational complexity of the SCR
