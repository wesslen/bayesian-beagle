**Summary:**

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the advancements and applications of large language models (LLMs) in the healthcare sector, with a focus on clinical applications. The study traces the evolution of LLMs from their foundational technologies to the latest developments in domain-specific models and multimodal integration. It discusses the opportunities these technologies present for enhancing clinical efficiency and the challenges they pose in terms of ethics, data privacy, and implementation. The paper also critically evaluates the deployment strategies of LLMs, emphasizing the necessity of open-source models to ensure data privacy and adaptability within healthcare environments. Future research directions are proposed, focusing on empirical studies to evaluate the real-world efficacy of LLMs in healthcare and the development of open datasets for further research.

**Major Findings:**

1. The emergence of advanced language and multimodal models, such as the GPT family, Gemini, and the Llama series, offers unprecedented perspectives for the transformation of the healthcare sector.
2. Open-source LLMs are publicly accessible and can be customized and adapted to specific needs, including deployment on private servers, which enhances data privacy and ownership in sensitive fields like medicine.
3. Domain-specific LLMs, such as those tailored for the medical field, can produce more accurate and relevant responses within that specific area.
4. LLMs can be used in various medical applications, including text generation, token classification, sequence classification, question answering, information extraction, summarization, paraphrasing, and conversation.
5. The deployment of LLMs in healthcare presents several challenges, including maintaining patient autonomy, ensuring data confidentiality, safeguarding against data breaches, and addressing training data biases.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the advancements and applications of LLMs in the healthcare sector. However, it does not delve deeply into the methodological issues, conflicting evidence, or areas that require further research or clarification. The paper also does not discuss the potential biases or limitations of the reviewed studies. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a detailed exploration of the potential risks and ethical implications of using LLMs in healthcare, which is a critical aspect that needs to be addressed.

The paper also does not discuss the potential impact of LLMs on
