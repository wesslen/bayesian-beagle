### Summary:

- The article proposes a novel multi-tool application framework for mathematical reasoning, utilizing a large language model (LLM) and combining the collaborative effects of multiple external tools to achieve more comprehensive and accurate mathematical reasoning.
- The framework utilizes various external tools such as Math Tool, Code Tool, CoT Tool, and self-consistency tools in the inference process through a large language model to provide diverse inference support.
- The unique contribution of this paper lies in the implementation of a self-consistency tool, which selects the final answer based on different parameters and the occurrence count of answers from different tools.
- The proposed framework was tested on the NumGLUE Task 4 test set, which includes 220 mathematical reasoning fill-in-the-blank questions. The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 89.09, compared with the GPT3+FewShot baseline and Fine tuning baseline, Few Shot+ERNIE-4.0+self consistency improved by 49.09% and 52.29%, respectively.

### Major Findings:

1. The proposed multi-tool application framework for mathematical reasoning, utilizing a large language model and combining the collaborative effects of multiple external tools, achieved significant performance improvement in mathematical reasoning tasks.
2. The self-consistency tool, which selects the final answer based on different parameters and the occurrence count of answers from different tools, is a unique contribution of this paper.
3. The proposed framework was tested on the NumGLUE Task 4 test set, which includes 220 mathematical reasoning fill-in-the-blank questions, and achieved an accuracy of 89.09, outperforming the GPT3+FewShot baseline and Fine tuning baseline.

### Analysis and Critique:
