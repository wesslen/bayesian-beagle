### Summary:

The paper introduces FVEL, an interactive formal verification environment that leverages large language models (LLMs) for automated theorem proving (ATP) in formal verification (FV). FVEL transforms FV dependencies and requests into ATP theories and lemmas, and the verification processes into lemma proofs. The authors extract and cleanse a large-scale dataset, FVELer, containing deep dependencies among Isabelle theorems and lemmas for C code formulation. The dataset supports interactive C code verification with LLMs. The paper benchmarks FVELer by fine-tuning LLMs and interacting with the FVEL environment, evaluating Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B on Code2Inv and SV-COMP. The results show improvements, with reduced proof error proportions, demonstrating the benefits of FVEL and FVELer.

### Major Findings:

1. FVEL is an interactive formal verification environment that interacts with LLMs for ATP in FV, transforming FV dependencies and requests into ATP theories and lemmas, and verification processes into lemma proofs.
2. FVELer is a large-scale dataset with deep dependencies among Isabelle theorems and lemmas for C code formulation, supporting interactive C code verification with LLMs.
3. Benchmarking FVELer with fine-tuned LLMs in the FVEL environment shows performance improvements on representative code verification benchmarks, with reduced proof errors.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents an innovative approach to formal verification by integrating large language models and automated theorem proving. The proposed FVEL environment and FVELer dataset provide a promising foundation for further research in this area. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential biases in the proposed approach. Additionally, the evaluation could be expanded to include more diverse benchmarks and a broader range of LLMs. Lastly, the paper could provide more insights into the generalizability of the proposed approach to other programming languages and formal verification tasks.
