# Summary

The increasing amount of data on the internet and the laborious task of manual claim and fact verification have led to the development of automated claim verification systems. This survey focuses on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in claim verification, which have shown superior performance in several NLP tasks. The survey covers the different components of the claim verification pipeline, including retrieval, prompting, and fine-tuning, and describes publicly available English datasets created for this task.

## Major Findings

1. LLMs have been successful in claim verification, but they are prone to hallucinations and can generate incorrect information.
2. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a novel method used in claim verification to aid LLMs in their decision-making abilities.
3. LLMs can be used to generate misinformation at scale, which can be exploited by malicious actors to spread wrong and factually incorrect information.
4. LLMs can generate incorrect veracity labels, as they may rely on obsolete information to assess the veracity of a claim.
5. Several English datasets have been created for claim verification, but there is a lack of multilingual fact-verification datasets.

## Analysis and Critique

* The survey provides a comprehensive account of recent claim verification frameworks using LLMs, but it does not discuss the limitations and potential biases of these models.
* The survey does not discuss the methodological issues and conflicting evidence in the use of LLMs for claim verification.
* The survey does not provide a critical evaluation of the performance of LLMs in claim verification compared to traditional NLP-based models.
* The survey does not discuss the potential risks and ethical implications of using LLMs for claim verification.
* The survey does not provide a detailed analysis of the performance of LLMs in handling complex and long claims.
* The survey does not discuss the potential applications of LLMs in claim verification beyond text-based data.
* The survey does not discuss the potential impact of LLMs on the labor market and the future of fact-checking.
* The survey does not discuss the potential impact of LLMs on the spread of misinformation and the role of fact-checking organizations in the age of LLMs.
* The survey does not discuss the potential impact of LLMs on the development of new fact-checking
