Key Findings:

- LLM-based agents present a promising solution to the limitations faced by Large Language Models (LLMs) in pragmatic applications, thanks to their potent natural language processing and comprehensive knowledge.
- The Rethinking capability of LLM-based agents involves evaluating prior decisions and subsequent environmental feedback, enabling introspection and improvement of agent performance.
- LLM-based agents can interact and learn from various environments, including computer, gaming, code, real-world, and simulation environments, providing robust solutions for different tasks.

### Introduction
Introduces the concept of intelligent agents and their autonomous capabilities in perceiving the environment and taking actions without external instructions.

### Overview
- Discusses single-agent and multi-agent systems, delving into their differences and application domains.

### LLM-based Agent System Framework
- Details the components of the LLM-based single agent system, including planning, memory, rethinking, environment, and action.
- Explores the mechanisms of deploying LLM-based agents in multi-agent systems, such as relationship of multi-agent systems, planning type, and methods of enhancing communication efficiency.

### Performance Evaluation
- Covers the prevalent datasets and evaluation methodologies for agents.

### Prospect Applications
- Examines the employment of LLM-based agents across diverse domains, encompassing natural sciences, social sciences, engineering systems, and general domains.

### Discussion
- Investigates the developmental trajectories of LLM-based agents, including augmenting adaptive capacity, incorporating multimodal models, and addressing challenges.

### Conclusion
Concludes the paper by summarizing the contributions and envisioning prospects for LLM-based agents.

Critique:
