**Major Takeaways**
- The paper introduces the concept of Composition to Augment Language Models (CALM) which enables the composition of existing foundational language models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities.
- The CALM framework introduces cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities, allowing for the reuse of existing models with established capabilities.
- The paper demonstrates the practical applications of CALM in language inclusivity and code generation, showing significant improvements in translation, arithmetic reasoning, and code-related tasks.

**Introduction**
- Large Language Models (LLMs) have foundational capabilities and have been fine-tuned for domain-specific capabilities, resulting in the development of several specialized large models with domain-specific capabilities.
- The paper aims to enable the composition of an anchor model with a domain-specific augmenting model to enable new capabilities, such as composing an augmenting model’s code understanding capability with an anchor LLM’s language generation capability to enable code-to-text generation capability.

**The CALM Framework**
- CALM aims to compose an anchor model and an augmenting model to enable new capabilities as a composition of capabilities of the two individual models.
- It operates over a selected set of layers from the anchor and augmenting models and introduces a small number of trainable parameters over these layers.
- The composition training data depicts a "combined skill" of the given models for the target composition domain and is used to learn the composition parameters.

**Experiments**
- The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of CALM in three domains: key-value arithmetic, low-resource language inclusivity, and code completion and explanation tasks.
- The experiments show the significant improvements achieved by composing an augmenting model with an anchor LLM, surpassing the individual models and versions that have been fine-tuned for the specific tasks.

**Critique**
- The paper lacks a discussion on the potential limitations or challenges of the CALM framework, such as its scalability to larger models or its adaptability to diverse languages and domains.
- The experimental results could benefit from a more extensive comparison with other relevant methods or frameworks to establish the unique advantages of CALM.
