### Summary:
- The DefInt framework proposes a novel approach to efficient reasoning with hybrid large language models (LLMs) by leveraging the strengths of System 1 and System 2 in human cognition.
- It achieves state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy and solution diversity while substantially reducing token cost by 49%∼79% compared to other methods.
- The framework demonstrates the potential to deliver human-like efficient and accurate reasoning across various tasks.

### Major Findings:
1. DefInt consistently achieves state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy and solution diversity.
2. The framework substantially reduces token cost by 49%∼79% compared to other methods.
3. DefInt harnesses the synergistic potential of larger and smaller language models for efficient and accurate reasoning.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The DefInt framework offers a promising approach to balancing reasoning accuracy and efficiency by integrating the strengths of System 1 and System 2 in human cognition.
- It addresses the challenges of handling complex reasoning problems with open-ended real-world tasks and offers a novel direction for efficient and accurate LLM reasoning.
- The empirical intervention rates and ablation study results provide valuable insights into the impact of different LLM synergy options on reasoning tasks, emphasizing the importance of cost-efficient reasoning with LLMs and the potential of the DefInt framework to address this challenge effectively.
