### Summary:

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of important design choices in training Large Time Series Models (LTSMs), focusing on pre-processing techniques, model configurations, and dataset configurations. The authors propose a novel statistical prompting strategy called time series prompt, which generates prompts by extracting global features from the training dataset. The study introduces LTSM-bundle, which bundles the best design choices identified in the analysis for training LTSMs. Empirical results demonstrate that LTSM-bundle achieves superior zero-shot and few-shot performances compared to state-of-the-art LTSMs and traditional TSF methods on benchmark datasets.

### Major Findings:

1. Time series prompt, a statistical prompting strategy, enhances LTSM training by extracting global features from the training dataset, providing a robust statistical description of each dataset.
2. LTSM-bundle, which incorporates and bundles the most effective design choices identified in the study, yields superior zero-shot and few-shot performances compared to state-of-the-art LTSMs on benchmark datasets.
3. With just 5% training data, LTSM-bundle achieves comparable performance as the baselines trained on the full training data, showing the promise of its generalization capability.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper provides a thorough analysis of various design choices in training LTSMs, offering valuable insights for future research in this domain. The proposed time series prompt and LTSM-bundle demonstrate promising results, outperforming existing methods in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. However, the study could benefit from further investigation into the limitations and potential biases of the proposed methods. Additionally, exploring the applicability of LTSM-bundle in real-world scenarios and comparing its performance with other state-of-the-art methods would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness.
