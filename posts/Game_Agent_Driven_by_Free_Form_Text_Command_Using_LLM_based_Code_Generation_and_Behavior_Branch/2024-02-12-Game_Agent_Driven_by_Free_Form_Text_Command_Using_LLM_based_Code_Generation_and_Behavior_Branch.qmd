### **Summary:**
- The paper proposes a text command control system for game agents that can understand natural language commands expressed in free-form. 
- It uses a large language model (LLM) for code generation to interpret and transform natural language commands into behavior branches, facilitating execution by the game agent. 
- Empirical validation within a game environment simulating a Pok√©mon game confirmed the system's ability to understand and carry out natural language commands.

### Major Findings:
1. The proposed system enables game agents to comprehend and execute free-form natural language commands.
2. It introduces a new knowledge expression, the behavior branch, facilitating real-time addition of new commands for continuous actions by the agent.
3. The study's practical performance suggests that it may be applicable to actual game systems.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study's practical performance suggests that it may be applicable to actual game systems.
- The 'good' ratio was decent, but the 'bad' commands indicate a need to improve the language translation.
- The response could be enhanced through further prompt engineering, adding more condition nodes, or improving the LLM itself.
- The study's practical performance suggests that it may be applicable to actual game systems.
- Further investigation is desired to decrease I/O latency, connect with voice recognition, and clarify the best practice of making the code prompt.
