### **Summary:**

- Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential across various applications and domains, including games.
- This paper surveys the current state of the art across the various applications of LLMs in and for games.
- Underexplored areas and promising directions for future uses of LLMs in games are discussed.

### **Major Findings:**

1. LLMs can take various roles within a game, such as playing a game, designing a game, or modeling players.
2. LLMs can be used to generate game content, such as levels, missions, and dialogue, and to provide assistance to players and designers.
3. LLMs can improve the accessibility and inclusivity of games by providing alternative ways of interacting with the game world and generating diverse and inclusive content.

### **Analysis and Critique:**

- While LLMs have shown promising results in generating text, they can
