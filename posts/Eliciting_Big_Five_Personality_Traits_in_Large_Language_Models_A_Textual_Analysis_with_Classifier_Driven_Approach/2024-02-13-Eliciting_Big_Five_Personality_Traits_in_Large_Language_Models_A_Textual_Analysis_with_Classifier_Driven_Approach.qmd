### Summary:
- The study examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recruitment and the ethical concerns related to their lack of transparency.
- The study uses a novel elicitation approach with prompts derived from common interview questions and prompts designed to elicit particular Big Five personality traits.
- Results reveal that LLMs demonstrate high openness and low extraversion, with newer and larger LMs exhibiting a broader range of personality traits. Fine-tuned models exhibit minor modulations in their personality traits, contingent on the dataset.
- The section discusses the OPT models, fine-tuned versions of GPT-2 and GPT-J-6B, and the interview prompt design for trait elicitation.
- The study found that language models had high levels of openness, low extraversion, and moderate levels of the other Big Five traits. Unlike humans, these models are not influenced by trait-activation, likely due to the absence of social cues in computational models.
- The study compares the performance of different language models, including GPT, Mistral, and Llama2, in responding to standard and trait-activating interview questions. The results show that smaller language models exhibit consistent responses across different types of questions, with a notable increase in emotional stability and agreeableness traits.

### Major Findings:
1. LLMs demonstrate high openness and low extraversion, with newer and larger LMs exhibiting a broader range of personality traits.
2. Language models had high levels of openness, low extraversion, and moderate levels of the other Big Five traits, and were not influenced by trait-activation.
3. The size and architecture of language models have a significant impact on their ability to exhibit and respond to personality traits.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study's findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of LLMs with different parameter sizes and their susceptibility to trait-activation, which has implications for their use in recruitment processes.
- The study's methodology and the inclusion of a wide range of LLMs contribute to a comprehensive analysis of their personality traits.
- The findings underscore the need for transparency and ethical considerations in the use of generative AI tools for interview preparation, and the potential impact on applicants' perceived personality traits and the integrity of hiring decisions.
- The study provides valuable insights into the potential applications and limitations of using large language models for personality assessment and highlights the importance of considering model size and fine-tuning processes in such applications.
