### Major Takeaways
1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)** have displayed exceptional proficiency in understanding and generating human-like text but face the challenge of computationally intensive training due to their extensive parameterization. They require frequent updates for correcting outdated information or integrating new knowledge.
2. There is a growing interest in **knowledge editing** techniques for LLMs to efficiently modify their behaviors within specific domains while preserving overall performance across various inputs. This paper provides a comprehensive review of cutting-edge approaches and introduces a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for evaluating these approaches.
3. The paper delves into the mechanisms of **knowledge storage** in LLMs and addresses the challenges of factual fallacy, potential generation of harmful content, and outdated knowledge. It also outlines potential applications of knowledge editing, including efficient machine learning, AI-Generated Content, trustworthy AI, and human-computer interaction.

### Introduction
The introduction outlines the importance of knowledge in human intelligence and civilization and the remarkable capabilities of LLMs in natural language processing. It highlights the challenges faced by LLMs due to their training cut-off and the need for ongoing updates for correcting deficiencies and integrating new knowledge.

### Background
- Describes the **Transformer model**, a cornerstone in the design of modern LLMs, and its key components, including the self-attention and feed-forward modules.
- Discusses the **mechanism of knowledge storage** in LLMs, with an emphasis on the intricate organization of knowledge within LLMs and the challenges in comprehensively understanding their knowledge structures.
- Explores **related techniques** such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning and knowledge augmentation for LLMs.

### Knowledge Editing for LLMs
- Presents a **taxonomy** of knowledge editing methods, categorizing them into three groups: resorting to external knowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge.
- Introduces the **KnowEdit** benchmark for empirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches and provides insights into the impact of knowledge editing on general tasks and multi-task knowledge editing.

### Experiments
- Details the experiment settings and presents the main results, including the efficacy and usability of knowledge editing methods.
- Discusses the impact of knowledge editing on general tasks and multi-task knowledge editing, along with error and case analysis.

### Analysis
- Compares different knowledge editing methods and explores the effectiveness of knowledge locating in LLMs.
- Examines the implicit knowledge structure in LLMs and highlights the need for careful consideration of potential unintended consequences of knowledge editing.

### Applications
- Explores various potential applications of knowledge editing, including efficient machine learning, AI-Generated Content (AIGC), trustworthy AI, and human-computer interaction: personalized agents.

### Discussion and Conclusion
- Discusses the broader impacts of knowledge editing techniques and emphasizes efficiency and innovation in the realm of LLMs.
- Intends to support and encourage future research by making tools, codes, data splits, and trained model checkpoints publicly accessible.

### Critique
The paper provides a comprehensive overview of knowledge editing for LLMs and introduces a new benchmark. However, the extensive listing of references in the introduction and background sections may be overwhelming. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a clearer delineation of the practical implications and limitations of the proposed knowledge editing techniques.
