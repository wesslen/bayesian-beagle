### Summary:

The article presents a novel neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for synthesizing diagnostic conversations of mental disorders using large language models. The framework takes patient cases as input and generates multiple diverse conversations with one single patient case. The framework involves the interaction between a doctor agent and a patient agent, and achieves text generation under symbolic control via a dynamic diagnosis tree from a tool agent. The proposed framework was used to develop the largest Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset, MDD-5k, which contains 5000 high-quality long conversations with diagnosis results as labels. Human evaluation demonstrates that the proposed MDD-5k dataset successfully simulates human-like diagnostic processes of mental disorders.

### Major Findings:

1. The proposed neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for synthesizing diagnostic conversations of mental disorders features controllable and diverse one-to-many patientcase-to-dialogue generation.
2. The largest Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset, MDD-5k, was proposed, which contains 5000 high-quality long conversations with convincing diagnosis results as labels.
3. Comprehensive human evaluation shows that the proposed MDD-5k dataset outperforms several compared datasets in professionalism, communication skills, fluency, safety, and mirrors human-like diagnostic processes.

### Analysis and Critique:

The proposed neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for synthesizing diagnostic conversations of mental disorders is a significant contribution to the field of AI mental healthcare research. The framework's ability to generate multiple diverse conversations with one single patient case is a novel approach that maximizes the utilization of precious real patient cases. The proposed MDD-5k dataset is also a significant contribution, as it is the largest Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset with diagnosis results from professional psychiatrists.

However, there are some limitations to the proposed framework. First, the discrepancy between synthesized conversations and actual medical diagnostics remains a significant challenge. Large language models often struggle to interpret the full meaning of patient responses when they encapsulate diverse information aspects, consequently leading to redundant symptom inquiries. Second, the proposed framework mainly designs dynamic diagnosis trees for depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, childhood emotional disorder, and unspecified mood disorder, which covers over 85% conversations of MDD-
