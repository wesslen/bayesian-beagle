### Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework, TRIPLE (besT aRm Identification for Prompt LEarning), to address the prompt learning problem under a limited budget. The framework is based on a systematic connection between prompt learning and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB). TRIPLE is designed to harness the power of BAI-FB in prompt learning systematically and includes two embedding-based enhancements to handle large prompt pools. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks using both GPT 3.5 and Llama2 demonstrate the significant performance improvement of TRIPLE over previous baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints.

### Major Findings:
1. The framework TRIPLE significantly outperforms previous baselines in prompt learning while satisfying limited budget constraints.
2. The two embedding-based enhancements, TRIPLE-CLST and TRIPLE-GSE, demonstrate remarkable improvements in handling large prompt pools.
3. TRIPLE can be integrated into end-to-end prompt learning pipelines, providing better performance than previous implementations.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article provides a comprehensive and systematic approach to prompt learning under a limited budget, addressing a practical concern that has been largely ignored in previous research.
- The proposed framework, TRIPLE, demonstrates superior performance over previous baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in prompt selection.
- The embedding-based enhancements, TRIPLE-CLST and TRIPLE-GSE, provide innovative solutions to handle large prompt pools, further improving the efficiency of prompt learning.
- The article lacks a detailed discussion of potential limitations or challenges associated with the proposed framework and its practical implementation. Further exploration of these aspects could enhance the comprehensiveness of the study.
