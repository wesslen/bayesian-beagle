### Summary:

The paper presents a novel assistive technology, Savant, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to enable blind screen reader users to interact uniformly with any application interface using natural language. Savant simplifies and speeds up interactions with screen readers by automating a sequence of laborious screen reader actions on the application's control elements when triggered by a natural language command (NLC) from the user. These commands offer flexibility as they do not strictly require the user to identify the precise names of the control elements in the NLC.

A user study evaluation of Savant with blind participants demonstrated significant improvements in interaction efficiency and usability compared to current practices. Savant showed significant improvements in both perceived usability (7.3 times higher SEQ score) and task workload (2.7 times lower NASA-TLX score) over status-quo screen readers, for typical computer tasks that involve accessing controls in a diverse set of applications. Participants were also able to access application controls nearly 5.5 times faster on average than with screen readers alone while doing these tasks. The accuracy of LLM-based interpretation and automation of participant commands was also high with a 92.5% accuracy score.

### Major Findings:

1. Savant, a novel assistive technology, enables blind screen reader users to interact uniformly with any application interface using natural language.
2. Savant automates a sequence of laborious screen reader actions on the application's control elements when triggered by a natural language command (NLC) from the user.
3. A user study evaluation of Savant with blind participants demonstrated significant improvements in interaction efficiency and usability compared to current practices.
4. Savant showed significant improvements in both perceived usability (7.3 times higher SEQ score) and task workload (2.7 times lower NASA-TLX score) over status-quo screen readers.
5. Participants were able to access application controls nearly 5.5 times faster on average than with screen readers alone while doing these tasks.
6. The accuracy of LLM-based interpretation and automation of participant commands was high with a 92.5% accuracy score.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a promising approach to addressing the challenges faced by blind individuals in navigating diverse and complex graphical user interfaces
