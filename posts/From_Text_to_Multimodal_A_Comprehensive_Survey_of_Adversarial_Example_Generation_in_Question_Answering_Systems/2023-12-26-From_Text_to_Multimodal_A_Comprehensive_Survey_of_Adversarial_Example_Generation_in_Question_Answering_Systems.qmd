### Summary:

The academic article provides a comprehensive overview of adversarial attacks on question answering (QA) systems, focusing on both textual and multimodal contexts. It covers techniques for generating adversarial examples, defense strategies, evaluation metrics, and potential future research directions. The impact of adversarial examples on QA systems' performance is emphasized, and the importance of robustness and reliability in handling adversarial attacks is highlighted.

### Major Findings:
1. Adversarial examples have a significant impact on the performance of QA systems, leading to decreased accuracy and inconsistent answers.
2. Various techniques and models, such as Adv-BERT, GANs, and autoencoders, are used for generating adversarial questions within QA systems.
3. Adversarial datasets and evaluation metrics play a crucial role in enhancing the robustness and reliability of QA models against adversarial attacks.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerabilities and robustness of QA systems, particularly in the context of adversarial examples. It highlights the potential impact of adversarial examples on QA systems' performance and emphasizes the need for defense strategies and evaluation metrics to address these challenges. The discussion also underscores the significance of controlled adversarial attacks in evaluating the robustness of QA systems. However, the article could benefit from further exploration of real-world applications and practical implications of adversarial attacks on QA systems. Additionally, more in-depth discussions on the ethical considerations and potential biases in adversarial question generation would enhance the article's overall impact. Further research is needed to address these limitations and advance the field of adversarial attacks on QA systems.
