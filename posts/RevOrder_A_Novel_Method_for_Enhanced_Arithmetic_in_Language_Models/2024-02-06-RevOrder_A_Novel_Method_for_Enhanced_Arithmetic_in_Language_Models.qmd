### Summary:
- The paper introduces RevOrder, a novel technique aimed at improving arithmetic operations in large language models (LLMs) by reversing the output digits in addition, subtraction, and n-digit by 1-digit (nD by 1D) multiplication tasks.
- RevOrder significantly reduces the Count of Sequential Intermediate Digits (CSID) to O(1), a new metric introduced to assess equation complexity.
- Through comprehensive testing, RevOrder achieves perfect accuracy in basic arithmetic operations and substantially boosts LLM performance in division tasks, particularly with large numbers where traditional models struggle.

### Major Findings:
1. RevOrder significantly reduces the Count of Sequential Intermediate Digits (CSID) to O(1), improving arithmetic operations in large language models (LLMs).
2. RevOrder achieves perfect accuracy in basic arithmetic operations and substantially boosts LLM performance in division tasks, particularly with large numbers where traditional models struggle.
3. Implementation of RevOrder is cost-effective for both training and inference phases.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The paper presents a novel and effective technique, RevOrder, for enhancing arithmetic operations in large language models.
- The method significantly reduces the complexity of arithmetic equations and improves the accuracy of LLMs in performing arithmetic tasks.
- The study provides comprehensive testing and demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of implementing RevOrder for both training and inference phases.
- The potential shortcomings of RevOrder may include challenges in maintaining accuracy in large-digit division tasks and the need for further research to address these limitations.
- The paper highlights the importance of integrating RevOrder into LLMs' pretraining to enhance arithmetic capabilities more fundamentally than fine-tuning.
