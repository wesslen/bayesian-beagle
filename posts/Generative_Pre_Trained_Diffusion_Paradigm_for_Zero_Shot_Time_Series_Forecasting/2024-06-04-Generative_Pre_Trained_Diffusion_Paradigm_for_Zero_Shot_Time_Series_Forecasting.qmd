### Summary:

The paper explores the Generative Pre-trained Diffusion (GPD) paradigm for zero-shot time series forecasting (TSF). The authors propose a simple MLP network for modeling and a zero-shot and tuning-free method for predicting future data using historical data as prompts. The GPD paradigm is established on the time series modality, effectively preventing the phenomenon of concept drift, and enabling flexible forecasting of arbitrary lengths. The authors demonstrate that the GPD paradigm achieves comprehensive performance and generalization comparable to current SOTA LLM-based and deep model paradigms on mainstream benchmarks and various TSF tasks.

### Major Findings:

1. The GPD paradigm demonstrates comprehensive performance comparable to LLM-based and deep model paradigms.
2. The GPD paradigm is constructed based on the time series modality, offering good interpretability and avoiding conceptual drift.
3. The GPD paradigm can flexibly apply any historical and future lengths within the maximum length.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the GPD paradigm with other diffusion paradigms in terms of computational complexity and memory requirements.
2. The authors do not discuss the potential limitations of the GPD paradigm, such as its ability to handle non-stationary time series or time series with missing values.
3. The paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the GPD paradigm can be extended to handle multivariate time series or time series with multiple seasonal patterns.
4. The authors do not discuss the potential applications of the GPD paradigm in other domains, such as finance, healthcare, and transportation.
5. The paper does not provide a clear roadmap for future research in the area of generative pre-trained diffusion paradigms for time series forecasting.
