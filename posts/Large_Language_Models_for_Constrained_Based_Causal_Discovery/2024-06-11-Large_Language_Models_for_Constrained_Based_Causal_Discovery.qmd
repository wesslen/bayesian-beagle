### Summary:

This paper explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an alternative to domain experts for causal graph generation. The authors frame conditional independence queries as prompts to LLMs and employ the PC algorithm with the answers. The performance of the LLM-based conditional independence oracle on systems with known causal graphs shows a high degree of variability. The authors improve the performance through a proposed statistical-inspired voting schema that allows some control over false-positive and false-negative rates. Inspecting the chain-of-thought argumentation, they find causal reasoning to justify its answer to a probabilistic query. The authors show evidence that knowledge-based CIT could eventually become a complementary tool for data-driven causal discovery.

### Major Findings:

1. LLMs can be used as an alternative to domain experts for causal graph generation by framing conditional independence queries as prompts.
2. The performance of the LLM-based conditional independence oracle on systems with known causal graphs shows a high degree of variability.
3. A statistical-inspired voting schema can improve the performance of the LLM-based conditional independence oracle and allow some control over false-positive and false-negative rates.
4. Causal reasoning can be found in the chain-of-thought argumentation of LLMs when answering a probabilistic query.
5. Knowledge-based CIT could become a complementary tool for data-driven causal discovery.

### Analysis and Critique:

* The paper provides a novel approach to causal graph generation using LLMs, which could be a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in various fields.
* The authors acknowledge the variability in the performance of the LLM-based conditional independence oracle and propose a statistical-inspired voting schema to improve its performance.
* The paper does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach, and further research is needed to assess its effectiveness and limitations.
* The paper does not discuss the potential biases and limitations of LLMs in generating causal graphs, which could be an important consideration for researchers and practitioners.
* The paper does not provide a clear comparison between the proposed approach and existing methods for causal graph generation, which could be useful for researchers and practition
