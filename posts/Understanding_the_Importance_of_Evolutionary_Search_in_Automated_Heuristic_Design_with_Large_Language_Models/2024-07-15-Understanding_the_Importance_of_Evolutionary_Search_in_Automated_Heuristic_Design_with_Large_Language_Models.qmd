**Summary:**

- Automated heuristic design (AHD) aims to automatically select, refine, or construct effective heuristics, eliminating the need for rich domain expertise.
- The advent of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new tools for AHD, with initial efforts focusing on framing AHD as an evolutionary program search (EPS) problem.
- This work seeks to address inconsistent benchmark settings, inadequate baselines, and lack of detailed component analysis in existing LLM-based EPS methods.
- A large-scale benchmark is conducted, examining all existing LLM-based EPS methods and a proposed baseline on four AHD problems across nine LLMs and five independent runs.
- The study provides empirical grounding for the importance of evolutionary search in LLM-based AHD approaches and contributes to the advancement of future EPS algorithmic development.

**Major Findings:**

1. The inherent generative capability of LLMs alone is insufficient for AHD problems, providing empirical justification for coupling LLMs with a search mechanism, i.e., the LLM-based EPS paradigm.
2. The performance of existing LLM-based EPS methods varies significantly across different AHD problems and LLM choices, suggesting more diverse benchmarks and applications are needed to establish a better understanding of this emergent paradigm for AHD.

**Analysis and Critique:**

- The study addresses the need for a more adequate baseline beyond random search and intuitive heuristics for a meaningful and representative comparison in AHD.
- The proposed baseline, ()-EPS, is inspired by the (1+1)-ES and few-shot prompting, aiming to simulate the lower bound of the performance of the EPS paradigm.
- The work provides a comprehensive evaluation of existing LLM-based EPS methods, highlighting the necessity of coupling LLMs with a search strategy for tackling AHD problems effectively.
- The study's findings contribute to the advancement of future EPS algorithmic development and foster accessibility and reproducibility by fully open-sourcing the benchmark and corresponding results.
- Potential limitations of the study include the focus on a specific set of LLMs and AHD problems, which may not generalize
