### Summary:

The paper presents a novel robotics system deployed in the social robot Nadine, which comprises three key modules: perception, interaction, and robot control modules. The perception module takes the role of understanding multiple modalities encompassing the user’s query and the environmental visual cues. The data is passed to the interaction module and used to generate appropriate robot behaviours through multiple components such as the dialogue manager, retrieval augmented generation (RAG)-based memory and knowledge system, and affective system. The robot can recognise the user (once the user has already interacted with it in the past time), and recall the episodic memory. At the same time, the robot generates its emotional internal states and reflects the emotion in generating its behaviour. The affective system helps the robot establish better connections with people.

### Major Findings:

1. The paper introduces SoR-ReAct, a novel LLM agent for the social robotic system employed in the Nadine social robot.
2. The robotic system demonstrates effective episodic memory of the recognised user.
3. The paper presents a sophisticated affective system that generates the robot’s emotions evoked from interactions with the user and detects the user’s emotions, which are reflected through the robot’s behaviours. Empirical observations revealed that these elements can help people experience a stronger connection with the robot.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel approach to developing an intelligent and robust social robotic system for the Nadine social robot platform. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the skilful leveraging of their powerful reasoning and instruction-following capabilities to achieve advanced human-like affective and cognitive capabilities is a significant contribution to the field. However, the paper does not provide a detailed evaluation of the system's performance or a comparison with existing state-of-the-art LLM-based agents. Additionally, the paper does not discuss any potential limitations or shortcomings of the proposed approach. Further research is needed to evaluate the system's performance and compare it with existing approaches.
