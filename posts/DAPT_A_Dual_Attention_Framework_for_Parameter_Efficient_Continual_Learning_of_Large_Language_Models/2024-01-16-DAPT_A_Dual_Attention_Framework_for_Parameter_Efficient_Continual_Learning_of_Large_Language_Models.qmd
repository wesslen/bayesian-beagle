### Summary:

The article introduces the Dual Attention Framework (DAPT) for parameter-efficient continual learning of large language models (LLMs). The framework addresses the challenges of catastrophic forgetting (CF) and knowledge transfer (KT) in continual learning by aligning the PET learning and selection processes. It consists of the Dual-Attentive Learning&Selection Module (DALS) and the Attentive Reflection Module (ARM). Extensive experiments on SuperNI and Long Sequence benchmarks demonstrate DAPT's superiority in resisting CF and facilitating KT, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to recent PET-based CL methods. The results and analysis section provides comprehensive evidence of the effectiveness of the DAPT framework in addressing the challenges of continual learning for large language models. The comparison with recent PET-based continual learning baselines, ablation study, and analysis of scale to larger backbone and unseen tasks highlight the significance of DAPT in overcoming catastrophic forgetting and promoting knowledge transfer. The section on dataset details provides a comprehensive overview of the datasets used for the experiments, highlighting the diversity of tasks included in the benchmarks. The detailed task orders and evaluation metrics demonstrate the thoroughness of the experimental design. Additionally, the fine-grained results section presents detailed results of the main experiments, showcasing the average performance at each time step and providing insights into the performance of different models across various tasks and benchmarks.

### Major Findings:
1. The Dual Attention Framework (DAPT) demonstrates superior performance in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and facilitating knowledge transfer in large language models.
2. DAPT outperforms recent PET-based continual learning baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in aligning the learning and selection of PET.
3. The framework's scalability to larger backbone models and previously unseen tasks underscores its potential impact in the field of natural language processing.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article presents a promising solution for addressing the challenges of continual learning in large language models. However, further research is needed to address the gap in completely overcoming catastrophic forgetting and enhancing backward transfer. Additionally, potential biases or limitations in the experimental design should be carefully considered to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the findings.
