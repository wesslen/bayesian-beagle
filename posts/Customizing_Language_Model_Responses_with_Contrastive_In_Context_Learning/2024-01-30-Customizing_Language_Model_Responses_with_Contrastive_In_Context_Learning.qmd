### **Summary:**
The article proposes an approach to customize large language models (LLMs) to align with user intent by using contrastive examples. The method involves providing positive examples that illustrate the true intent, along with negative examples that show what characteristics LLMs should avoid. The negative examples can be retrieved from labeled data, written by a human, or generated by the LLM itself. The approach significantly improves the performance of LLMs in generating desirable responses, as demonstrated in experiments on synthesized and real-world datasets, including StackExchange and Reddit.

### Major Findings:
1. The proposed approach of using contrastive examples significantly improves the performance of LLMs in generating desirable responses.
2. The negative examples obtained from LLM-generated responses were as effective as those from human-written data, demonstrating the flexibility and scalability of the approach.
3. Combining contrastive examples with the analysis of their characteristics resulted in even better performance, providing LLMs with a better understanding of user preferences.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article presents a novel and effective approach to customizing LLM responses using contrastive examples. However, the study could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the potential biases and limitations of the proposed method. Additionally, further research is needed to refine LLM instructions based on contrastive examples and to develop automatic prompt generation techniques to optimize LLM performance across diverse tasks. The article provides valuable insights into enhancing LLM alignment with user intent, but future work should address these areas for further improvement.
