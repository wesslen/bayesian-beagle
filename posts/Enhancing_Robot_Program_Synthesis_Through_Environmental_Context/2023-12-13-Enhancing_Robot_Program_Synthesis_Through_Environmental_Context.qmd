ve of the entire environment that may not always be feasible in reality. EVAPS overcomes this by leveraging partial environmental observations and aligning them with code syntax to provide more comprehensive guidance for program rectification.
ii) EVAPS introduces a novel framework that learns an environment embedding space to implicitly evaluate the impacts of each program token based on the precondition. This enables the model to effectively assess the global impact of the generated program tokens toward the desired output, even with partial observations.

While we recognize the need for further research and testing in real-world scenarios, the strong performance of EVAPS in a complex and noisy environment serves as a promising indication of its potential practical application.
