# Summary:
- The paper proposes a novel approach to probe the intrinsic manipulation of causality in large language models (LLMs) by providing different shortcuts and observing their behaviors.
- The authors use retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL) for models on a designed causality classification task.
- The experiments are conducted on mainstream LLMs, including GPT-4 and some smaller and domain-specific models.
- The results suggest that LLMs can detect entities related to causality and recognize direct causal relationships. However, LLMs lack specialized cognition for causality, merely treating them as part of the global semantic of the sentence.

# Major Findings:
1. LLMs can detect entities related to causality and recognize direct causal relationships.
2. LLMs lack specialized cognition for causality, treating causality as part of the global semantic of the sentence.
3. The proposed approach can effectively probe the intrinsic manipulation of causality in LLMs.

# Analysis and Critique:
- The paper provides a valuable contribution to the understanding of causality manipulation in LLMs.
- The proposed approach is innovative and effective in probing the intrinsic manipulation of causality in LLMs.
- The experiments are conducted on a diverse set of LLMs, which enhances the generalizability of the findings.
- However, the paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed approach or the potential biases in the experiments.
- The paper also does not provide a detailed analysis of the results, which could have helped to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.
- The paper could have also discussed the implications of the findings for the development and evaluation of LLMs.
