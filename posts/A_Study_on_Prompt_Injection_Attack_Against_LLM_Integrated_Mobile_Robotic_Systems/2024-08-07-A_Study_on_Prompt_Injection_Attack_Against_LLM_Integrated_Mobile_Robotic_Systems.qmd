**Summary:**

The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotic systems has led to advancements in embodied artificial intelligence, enabling more context-aware responses. However, this integration also introduces security risks, particularly in robotic navigation tasks. This study investigates the impact of prompt injections on mobile robot performance in LLM-integrated systems and explores secure prompt strategies to mitigate these risks. The findings demonstrate a substantial overall improvement of approximately 30.8% in both attack detection and system performance with the implementation of robust defence mechanisms.

**Major Findings:**

1. The study highlights the potential security risks associated with using LLMs in robotic navigation tasks, such as adversarial inputs leading to incorrect or dangerous navigational decisions.
2. The research explores the influence of prompt injection attacks on the security and reliability of LLM-integrated mobile robotic systems, revealing that LLMs with properly engineered prompts exhibit a higher detection rate of adversarial inputs and respond more effectively to mitigate their impact.
3. The experiments measured various attack rates and the LLMs' ability to detect these attacks, revealing that LLMs with secure prompting strategies showed a significant improvement in both attack detection and system performance.

**Analysis and Critique:**

While the study provides valuable insights into the security implications of LLM-integrated robotic systems, there are potential limitations and areas for further research. The study primarily focuses on the detection and mitigation of prompt injection attacks, but other types of attacks, such as data poisoning or model inversion, may also pose significant threats. Additionally, the study does not address the potential impact of these attacks on the physical environment or human safety. Further research is needed to explore these aspects and develop comprehensive security strategies for LLM-integrated robotic systems.
