### **Summary:**
- The paper introduces the text-to-CQL task, aiming to automate the translation of natural language into Corpus Query Language (CQL).
- A comprehensive framework for the text-to-CQL task is presented, including a large-scale dataset and methodologies leveraging large language models (LLMs) for effective text-to-CQL task.
- The paper establishes advanced evaluation metrics to assess the syntactic and semantic accuracy of the generated queries.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The paper introduces the text-to-CQL task, which aims to bridge the gap between natural language descriptions and their corresponding CQL representations.
2. The study presents a large-scale, diverse dataset for the text-to-CQL task, providing a benchmark for model evaluation.
3. The paper evaluates the performance of several state-of-the-art models and proposes a new evaluation metric, CQLBLEU, based on N-gram similarity and AST similarity.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- LLM capability assessment:
  - LLMs are almost incapable of writing CQL correctly without examples but understand the semantics expressed in human language.
  - The performance of the same large-sized BART model shows differences in the text-to-CQL tasks for both English and Chinese languages.
- Performance of PLM on different languages:
  - The addition of the "lemma" attribute in English CQL compared to Chinese contributes to differences in model performance.
- Performance of PLM on different query difficulties:
  - The model's performance deviates from expectations, showing a significantly better performance on condition type than on within type in some cases.
- Limitations:
  - The construction of the TCQL dataset is based on automatically generated and manually labeled data, which may limit its authenticity and meaningfulness.
  - The scalability of the proposed solution to longer text queries and its dependency on computational resources are concerns that may limit its applicability in resource-constrained settings.

The paper provides valuable insights into the challenges and potential of the text-to-CQL task, but limitations in dataset construction and model performance need to be addressed in future research.
