### Summary:

This paper investigates the integration of ChatGPT into EFL (English as a Foreign Language) oral presentation practice to provide personalized feedback. The authors introduce a novel learning platform, CHOP (ChatGPT-based interactive platform for oral presentation practice), and evaluate its effectiveness with 13 EFL students. By collecting student-ChatGPT interaction data and expert assessments of the feedback quality, the authors identify the platform’s strengths and weaknesses and analyze learners’ perceptions and key design factors.

### Major Findings:

1. **Effective Feedback Integration**: The study explores how to effectively integrate ChatGPT into oral presentation practice for EFL students, focusing on factors that affect feedback quality and learners’ perceptions.
2. **CHOP Platform Design**: The authors introduce CHOP, an interactive platform that uses ChatGPT to provide personalized feedback to EFL students for their oral presentation practice. The platform is designed to support PPT-based oral presentations and provides feedback across the following presentation criteria: Grammar, Vocabulary, Content, Organization, and Delivery.
3. **Experimental Results**: The study evaluates the effectiveness of the CHOP platform with feedback quality and learners’ perceptions. The results show that the platform is particularly effective in providing feedback on vocabulary, as perceived by both experts and students. However, the feedback system shows limitations in the delivery component, which received noticeably lower scores for level of detail and helpfulness.

### Analysis and Critique:

The study provides valuable insights into the potential of using ChatGPT to provide personalized feedback for EFL students in oral presentation practice. However, there are some limitations and areas for improvement. The platform only utilizes the user’s presentation notes and rehearsal transcript to generate feedback using ChatGPT, ignoring other useful input signals such as the raw rehearsal audio, PPT file, or the presenter’s visual cues. Incorporating such information could offer more comprehensive feedback. Additionally, as ChatGPT is a black-box language model, the feedback generated by the platform lacks transparency and clear rationale. Further research is needed to develop models capable of producing more explainable feedback.

The study also highlights the need for flexible feedback tailored to each student’s note type and the appropriate amount and
