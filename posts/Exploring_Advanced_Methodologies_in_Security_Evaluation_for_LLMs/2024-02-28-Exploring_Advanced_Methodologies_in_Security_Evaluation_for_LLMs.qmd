### **Summary:**
- Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced capabilities to handle complex language patterns and generate coherent text, images, audios, and videos.
- The rapid expansion of LLMs has raised security and ethical concerns, emphasizing the need for ongoing research into security evaluation during their development and deployment.
- The article provides a comprehensive analysis of commonly used evaluation metrics, advanced evaluation frameworks, and the routine evaluation processes for LLMs.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The proliferation of LLMs has raised security and ethical concerns, necessitating ongoing research into security evaluation during their development and deployment.
2. The article provides a comprehensive analysis of commonly used evaluation metrics, advanced evaluation frameworks, and the routine evaluation processes for LLMs.
3. The research highlights the need for more dedicated attention to security threats and evaluations of LLMs, particularly in the area of multimodal LLMs.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The article provides a comprehensive overview of evaluation metrics, evaluation frameworks, and evaluation processes for LLMs, addressing the need for more research in the area of multimodal LLMs.
- However, the article lacks a specific implementation plan necessary for conducting a security evaluation, and the discussion of known evaluation frameworks is not comprehensive.
- Future research should focus on the development of automated evaluation platforms, comprehensive coverage of threats, and dedicated research into the unique vulnerabilities and security complexities of multimodal LLMs.
