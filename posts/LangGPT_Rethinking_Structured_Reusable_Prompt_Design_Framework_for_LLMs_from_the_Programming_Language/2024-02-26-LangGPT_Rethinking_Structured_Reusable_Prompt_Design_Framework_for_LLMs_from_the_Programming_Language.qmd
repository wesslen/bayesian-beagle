### Summary:
- LLMs have shown impressive performance across various domains, but creating high-quality prompts for instructing LLMs is challenging for non-AI experts.
- Prompt engineering lacks a structured design template, resulting in high learning costs and low reusability.
- Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, LangGPT is proposed as a dual-layer prompt design framework for LLMs, significantly enhancing the capacity of LLMs to produce superior quality responses compared to baselines.

### Major Findings:
1. **Challenges in Prompt Engineering:**
   - Prompt engineering lacks a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability.
   - Existing research in prompt engineering suggests fragmented optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers.

2. **LangGPT Framework:**
   - LangGPT is a dual-layer prompt design framework inspired by structured reusable programming languages.
   - LangGPT significantly enhances the capacity of LLMs to produce responses of superior quality compared to baselines.

3. **Community and User Survey:**
   - A community has been built on LangGPT to facilitate the tuition and sharing of prompt design.
   - A user survey in the community verified the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The LangGPT framework addresses the limitations of existing prompt engineering methods by providing a structured and extensible prompt design framework. However, the evaluation metrics for LLM performance are subjective, and the lack of objective evaluation metrics may limit the generalizability of the findings.
- The user survey results indicate high user satisfaction with LangGPT's ease of use, but potential biases in the survey design and user demographics should be considered.
- Future work should focus on optimizing the design of LangGPT, reducing token consumption, and adding support for LLMs using third-party tools and custom tools. Additionally, addressing ethical concerns related to the application of LLMs is essential for future research.
