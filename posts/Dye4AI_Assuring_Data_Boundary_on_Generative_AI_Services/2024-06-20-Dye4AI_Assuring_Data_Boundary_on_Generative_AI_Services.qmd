### Summary:

The paper presents a dye testing system called Dye4AI, which is designed to ensure data boundary on third-party AI services. Dye4AI is effective in verifying if AI vendors misuse user data for model improvement. The system consists of three key stages: trigger generation, trigger insertion, and trigger retrieval. In the trigger generation stage, a new sequential trigger format is designed with a pseudo-random property. The trigger generation process involves embedding trigger ownership, ensuring non-privacy, and maintaining intelligibility and robustness. In the trigger insertion stage, a conversation strategy is used to insert each trigger item into dialogue and confirm that the model memorizes the new trigger knowledge in the current session. In the trigger retrieval stage, triggers are routinely tried to be retrieved with specific prompts in new sessions, as triggers can present in new sessions only if AI vendors leverage user data for model fine-tuning. The paper also presents extensive experiments on six LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the dye testing scheme in ensuring the data boundary, even for models with various architectures and parameter sizes.

### Major Findings:

1. Dye4AI is an effective dye testing system that can verify if AI vendors misuse user data for model improvement, ensuring data boundary on third-party services.
2. A new intelligible trigger is designed, derived from a pseudo-random number, retaining both stealthiness and robustness.
3. Extensive experiments on six different models demonstrate that Dye4AI is applicable to various LLMs, especially for the premier models.
4. The prompt selection strategy in the dye testing system is analyzed, providing insights for future LLM testing systems.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel approach to ensuring data boundary on third-party AI services. The proposed dye testing system, Dye4AI, is effective in verifying if AI vendors misuse user data for model improvement. The system consists of three key stages: trigger generation, trigger insertion, and trigger retrieval. The trigger generation process involves embedding trigger ownership, ensuring non-privacy, and maintaining intelligibility and robustness. The trigger insertion stage uses a conversation strategy to insert each trigger item into dialogue and confirm that the model memorizes the new trigger knowledge in the current session.
