### Summary

**TeamCAD** is a multimodal interface for remote computer-aided design that incorporates **speech and gesture recognition** to provide a collaborative user experience for spatial design processes. The interface aims to replicate the collaborative experience of working on a table in an online remote setting, utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning for voice and gesture recognition. The system's performance was evaluated through user studies, revealing both the potential and drawbacks of the proposed interface.

### Main Findings

1. **Multi-Modal Collaboration**: TeamCAD provides a user-friendly interface that enables remote collaboration in design processes through a combination of **speech and gesture recognition**. This approach aims to replicate the interactive and participatory nature of in-person design collaboration.

2. **Challenges with Speech Recognition**: While the multimodal approach proved to be beneficial for users with varying levels of experience, **speech recognition** posed challenges, particularly in terms of robustness and responsiveness. The limitations of the speech recognition system affected the overall usability and efficiency of the interface.

3. **User Studies and Performance Evaluation**: User studies conducted at different phases revealed insights into the performance and user experience of TeamCAD. The interface showed promise in equalizing the design process for users with varying skill levels, but also highlighted the need for further improvements in **speech recognition**.

### System Description

- **Speech and Gesture Recognition**: The system relies on speech recognition using the SpeechRecognition Python library, with real-time webcam gesture recognition using MediaPipe. This allows users to utilize voice commands and gestures to interact with a three-dimensional modeling or CAD software.

- **Interface Operation**: TeamCAD uses a heads-up display (HUD) to present a library of voice commands and allows users to manipulate objects through gestures, such as using pinching gestures for selection and grabbing. The system also enables users to issue voice commands for specific transformations and manipulations.

### User Studies and Performance

- **Experimental Phases**: The user studies were conducted in three iterative phases, focusing on prototype, implementation, and final studio phases. The experiments involved tasks such as creating an arch in Blender 3D, recording users' interactions, and measuring time spent on different activities.

- **Performance Evaluation**: Users spent varying amounts of time on different tasks, with manipulating objects and using speech recognition occupying a substantial amount of time. The results showed that speech recognition was less efficient and posed challenges related to robustness and usability.

### Critique

While TeamCAD demonstrates the potential for multimodal interfaces in remote collaborative design, the paper acknowledges several challenges, particularly in the area of **speech recognition**. The limitations and biases observed in the performance of speech recognition algorithms need to be addressed to ensure a more robust and user-friendly interface. Additionally, the reliance on third-party libraries and technologies may introduce dependencies and potential compatibility issues in real-world applications. The need for further development and improvement in the performance of the **speech recognition** component is crucial for the successful implementation of TeamCAD in practical design settings.
