### Major Takeaways

1. **Deplatforming reduces online attention**: The paper finds that deplatforming decreases online attention toward influencers, with a reduction of 63% on Google and 43% on Wikipedia after 12 months.

2. **Effectiveness of deplatforming**: Both permanent and temporary deplatforming reduce online attention toward influencers, suggesting that temporary bans may be as effective as permanent ones.

3. **Influencer characteristics**: The study reveals that deplatforming is more effective for influencers associated with higher attention and those disseminating misinformation.

### Sections Summary

#### Introduction
Deplatforming has gained attention due to its impact on controversial figures and has sparked political debate. Deplatformed individuals often migrate to alternative platforms, contributing to the creation of an "alt-tech" information ecosystem. Empirical evidence on the effectiveness of deplatforming has been inconclusive, which this study aims to address.

#### Background and Related Work
The section provides background on Reddit, Google Trends, and Wikipedia and discusses deplatforming and other content moderation interventions. It also discusses the existing literature on deplatforming and identifies the limitations of previous research.

#### Data Collection and Curation
The paper explains the methodology for obtaining and curating data on deplatforming events, including obtaining candidate pairs from Reddit, matching entities with Google Knowledge Graph identifiers, manual filtering, annotation, and further filtering, ensuring the completeness and correctness of deplatforming events, and obtaining online traces and additional filtering.

#### Changes in online attention following deplatforming
This section details the approach used for descriptive analysis and illustrates the monthly changes in online attention for deplatformed entities. It presents a fixed-effects model to describe changes in online attention post-deplatforming.

#### The causal effect of deplatforming on online attention
The section explains the difference-in-differences (DiD) approach used to estimate the causal effect of deplatforming on online attention and discusses the results obtained from the DiD approach. It also explores the heterogeneity of the effect based on different dimensions.

#### Discussion
The discussion covers the implications of the study findings, the methodology used, and future research avenues. It also addresses the challenges of deplatforming and potential external events influencing both attention and deplatforming.

### Critique

The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact of deplatforming on online attention toward influencers. However, it may benefit from deeper exploration and control for potential external events that can impact both deplatforming and online attention. Additionally, the study's focus on online attention as the primary outcome measure may not capture the full spectrum of effects of deplatforming on influencer behavior and societal impact. 

Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of deplatforming and its implications for online attention, and the meticulous data collection and advanced analytical methods strengthen the study's validity.
