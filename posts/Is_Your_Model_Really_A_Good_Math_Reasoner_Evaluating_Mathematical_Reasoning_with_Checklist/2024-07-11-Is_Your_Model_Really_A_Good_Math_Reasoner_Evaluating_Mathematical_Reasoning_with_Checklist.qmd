### Summary:

The paper introduces MathCheck, a well-designed checklist for testing task generalization and reasoning robustness in large language models (LLMs). The authors argue that if a model truly understands a problem, it should be able to apply its knowledge across various tasks and problem variations. MathCheck includes multiple mathematical reasoning tasks and robustness test types to evaluate both mathematical reasoning ability and behavior testing. The authors use MathCheck to develop MathCheck-GSM and MathCheck-GEO, which assess mathematical textual reasoning and multi-modal reasoning capabilities, respectively. They evaluate over 20 LLMs and 11 MLLMs using MathCheck-GSM and MathCheck-GEO, finding that while frontier LLMs like GPT-4o continue to excel, many other model families exhibit a significant decline. The results demonstrate that MathCheck better reflects true mathematical abilities and represents mathematical intelligence more linearly than traditional math benchmarks.

### Major Findings:

1. MathCheck is a well-designed checklist for testing task generalization and reasoning robustness in LLMs.
2. MathCheck includes multiple mathematical reasoning tasks and robustness test types to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of both mathematical reasoning ability and behavior testing.
3. MathCheck-GSM and MathCheck-GEO are developed using MathCheck to assess mathematical textual reasoning and multi-modal reasoning capabilities, respectively.
4. Over 20 LLMs and 11 MLLMs are evaluated using MathCheck-GSM and MathCheck-GEO, with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o continuing to excel while many other model families exhibit a significant decline.
5. MathCheck better reflects true mathematical abilities and represents mathematical intelligence more linearly than traditional math benchmarks.

### Analysis and Critique:

* The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' mathematical reasoning abilities using MathCheck, which includes multiple mathematical reasoning tasks and robustness test types.
* The authors' argument that a model that truly understands a problem should be able to apply its knowledge across various tasks and problem variations is well-supported by the results of the evaluation.
* The use of MathCheck-GSM and MathCheck-GEO to assess mathematical textual reasoning and multi-modal reasoning capabilities, respectively, is a novel approach that provides a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' mathematical reasoning abilities
