### Summary:

- The paper introduces a new confidence measure called Contextualized Sequence Likelihood (CSL) for natural language generation tasks.
- CSL enhances the predicted sequence probability by assigning different weights to various tokens using attention values elicited from the base LLM.
- CSL is easy to implement, fast to compute, and offers potential for further improvement with task-specific prompts.
- CSL has demonstrated significantly higher reliability than state-of-the-art baselines in predicting generation quality across several QA datasets and a diverse array of LLMs.

### Major Findings:

1. CSL significantly outperforms baselines in predicting the accuracy of each response, offering a more reliable confidence measure for natural language generation tasks.
2. CSL is easy to implement and fast to compute, making it a practical choice for practitioners.
3. CSL offers potential for further improvement with task-specific prompts, allowing for greater customization and flexibility.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The paper presents a promising new approach to confidence measures for natural language generation tasks.
- However, the interpretability of attention weights is often obscured by the nature of the self-attention mechanism, which may limit the practical application of CSL.
- The current prompt is tailored for question-answering and may require modifications for other tasks, limiting the generalizability of CSL.
- The current approach cannot leverage external information for "fact-checking," which may be a limitation in certain contexts.
- Future research should address these issues and expand the toolkit available to practitioners for assessing the reliability of large language models.
