### **Summary:**
- SemEval-2024 Task 8 focuses on detecting machine-generated text to prevent potential misuse of large language models (LLMs).
- The authors utilized language identification and fine-tuning of smaller LLMs for text classification to achieve competitive results.
- Their method achieved fourth place in the competition, just under 1 percentage point behind the winner.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The authors proposed a unique way of combining statistical and fine-tuned detection methods using a two-way majority voting and per-language threshold calibration.
2. They compared three ensemble system alternatives to cope with multilingual machine-generated text detection.
3. The authors experienced remarkably good performance of fine-tuned LLMs of 7B parameters in this task.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The authors mentioned that they started experiments only a few weeks before the deadline, which gave them little time to cope with problems such as over-fitting and hyper-parameter optimization.
- They used FastText language identification, which is not fully accurate, and only used language information if the prediction probability was greater than 0.5.
- The authors did not perform any hyper-parameter optimization due to time constraints, indicating that further improvements of the system are likely possible.
