### Summary:

This paper presents a novel guided deferral system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) in computer-aided clinical diagnosis. The system not only defers cases to human decision-makers but also provides intelligent guidance. The study evaluates the classification and deferral performance of two distinct sources of predictions: verbalised and hidden-state predictions. The authors demonstrate that instruction-tuning an open-source, efficient, and small-scale LLM on the guard-railed generation of a large-scale version of the same LLM leads to improved classification performance and deferral performance, surpassing even that of the latter.

### Major Findings:

1. The proposed guided deferral system for LLMs in computer-aided clinical diagnosis not only defers cases to human decision-makers but also provides intelligent guidance, improving the overall decision-making process.
2. The study evaluates the classification and deferral performance of two distinct sources of predictions: verbalised and hidden-state predictions. The combination of these sources leads to a significant improvement in prediction performance.
3. Instruction-tuning an open-source, efficient, and small-scale LLM on the guard-railed generation of a large-scale version of the same LLM results in improved classification performance and deferral performance, surpassing even that of the larger model.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents an innovative approach to human-AI collaboration in healthcare by introducing a guided deferral system that leverages LLMs. The proposed system addresses the limitations of current deferral systems by providing intelligent guidance to human decision-makers. The study's findings on the classification and deferral performance of verbalised and hidden-state predictions, as well as the benefits of instruction-tuning, are valuable contributions to the field.

However, the paper does not discuss potential limitations or biases in the proposed system. For instance, the reliance on LLMs for generating guidance may introduce biases or errors, which could impact the overall decision-making process. Additionally, the study does not address the potential challenges of implementing the proposed system in real-world clinical settings, such as the need for clinicians to understand the system's capabilities and limitations.

Future research should focus on addressing these limitations and evaluating the proposed system in real-world
