### **Summary:**
- The article introduces a novel alignment paradigm, priority rule following, to address the challenge of adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to diverse human values and regulatory standards.
- The proposed method, PriorityDistill, aims to enhance the integration and maintenance abilities of LLMs to align with rules on-the-fly, rather than directly learning preferences and regulations.
- The experiments demonstrate that the enhanced rule-based alignment ability helps the model mitigate more misaligned behaviors and achieve compliance with a wider range of regulations.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The proposed priority rule following paradigm enhances the model's ability to align with diverse regulations and mitigate misaligned behaviors.
2. PriorityDistill, a semi-automated process, effectively improves the model's ability to integrate and maintain rules, leading to shielded on-the-fly alignment.
3. The article identifies and annotates a set of benchmarks to examine the model's proficiency in on-the-fly alignment, providing a resource for future research.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The article presents a comprehensive approach to address the alignment problem in LLMs, but it acknowledges limitations and areas for future research.
- The method relies on simulated LLM responses to distill priority following signals, which may not fully capture real-world scenarios.
- The article emphasizes the importance of transparent alignment and the rejection of harmful rules, but it also acknowledges the need for clearer and more self-consistent rules in future research.

Overall, the article provides valuable insights into the development of on-the-fly aligned models and highlights the potential for future research to further enhance the alignment process. The proposed method shows promise in addressing the challenges of aligning LLMs with diverse human values and regulatory standards. However, further research is needed to address limitations and refine the alignment process.
