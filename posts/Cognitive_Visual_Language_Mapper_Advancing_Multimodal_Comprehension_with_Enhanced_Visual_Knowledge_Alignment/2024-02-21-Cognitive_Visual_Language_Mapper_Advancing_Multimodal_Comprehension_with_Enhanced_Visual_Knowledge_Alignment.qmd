### **Summary:**
- The article introduces the Cognitive Visual-Language Mapper (CVLM) to enhance Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with visual-language knowledge alignment, particularly for knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA).
- CVLM consists of a pretrained Visual Knowledge Aligner (VKA) and a Fine-grained Knowledge Adapter (FKA) used in the multimodal instruction tuning stage.
- Experimental results show that CVLM significantly improves the performance of LMMs on knowledge-based VQA, with an average gain of 5.0%.

### **Major Findings:**
1. CVLM significantly improves the performance of LMMs on knowledge-based VQA, with an average gain of 5.0%.
2. The Visual Knowledge Aligner (VKA) and Fine-grained Knowledge Adapter (FKA) are effective in enhancing the capabilities of LMMs for knowledge-based VQA.
3. The article highlights the limitations of existing LMMs in addressing knowledge-based VQA and proposes CVLM as a solution to this challenge.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The article presents a comprehensive and innovative approach to enhancing LMMs with visual-language knowledge alignment, addressing the limitations of existing models in knowledge-based VQA.
- The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CVLM in improving the performance of LMMs on knowledge-based VQA tasks, highlighting the potential of visual knowledge alignment in multimodal comprehension.
- The article acknowledges limitations in the accuracy of visual knowledge representations and the stability of language models infused with visual knowledge information, indicating areas for further research and improvement.
