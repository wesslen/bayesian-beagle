### Summary:
- The article discusses the challenges in aligning video and text modalities in large multimodal models (VLMMs) and proposes a novel approach called Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) to address this issue. 
- The authors also enhance the training for Video-Language Multimodal Models (VLMMs) through the introduction of additional video-text instruction-tune datasets and a curriculum learning strategy. 
- Additionally, the impact of context information on the performance of the video-based generative benchmark is studied, and the authors assess the performance of the VLM-SFT using varying LLM sizes, specifically 7B and 13B, across video question answering (VideoQA) and video-based generative benchmarks.

### Major Findings:
1. The proposed RLAIF method and context-aware reward modeling offer a promising solution to improve the understanding of video content and enhance the performance of VLMMs.
2. The introduction of additional video-text instruction-tune datasets and a curriculum learning strategy significantly improves the performance of VLMMs.
3. Larger LLM sizes lead to improved performance in video-based generative tasks, emphasizing the significance of model capacity in this context.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The proposed strategies have significant implications for the development of VLMMs and their applications in video understanding and question-answering tasks.
- The findings emphasize the importance of model size in capturing and generating complex video content representations, with implications for the selection of model sizes in the development of video question answering systems.
