### Summary:
- The paper proposes a novel perspective that considers the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as an "Information Refiner".
- It introduces an unsupervised training method named InFO-RAG that optimizes LLMs for RAG in a low-cost and general manner across various tasks.
- Extensive experiments on 11 datasets in diverse tasks show that InFO-RAG improves the performance of LLaMA2 by an average of 9.39% relative points and demonstrates advantages in in-context learning and robustness of RAG.

### Major Findings:
1. The proposed InFO-RAG method improves the performance of LLMs for RAG across various tasks by an average of 9.39% relative points.
2. InFO-RAG demonstrates advantages in in-context learning and robustness of RAG.
3. The paper introduces a novel perspective that considers the role of LLMs in RAG as an "Information Refiner".

### Analysis and Critique:
- The proposed InFO-RAG method shows significant improvements in RAG performance, especially in scenarios where retrieved texts contain incomplete, incorrect, or noisy information.
- The paper provides a thorough analysis of the robustness of InFO-RAG to changes in retrieval performance, positive passage position, and the number of retrieved passages.
- The experiments demonstrate that InFO-RAG avoids catastrophic forgetting and maintains the basic language understanding ability of LLMs.
- However, the paper is limited by the lack of experiments on models with larger parameter sizes due to computing resource constraints. Further exploration of the performance of larger models is recommended.
