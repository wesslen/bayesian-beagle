### Summary:
This article presents an optimization method for the synthesis of finite state machines (FSMs) using Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). The primary objective is to reduce the number of gates in the FSMs, thereby saving on-chip area and reducing the cost of the circuit. The authors evolved a list of FSMs from MCNC91 benchmark circuits using CGP and achieved an average of almost 30% reduction in the total number of gates. The effects of various parameters on the evolutionary process were also discussed.

### Major Findings:
1. The focus of the article is on reducing the number of gates in FSMs, leading to a significant reduction in the total number of MOSFETs used to construct the FSMs.
2. The CGP evolved FSMs achieved almost 30% reduction in the number of gates compared to conventional espresso-based designs.
3. The article also discusses the effects of different values of Î» on the circuit size and simulation time, showing that a simplified version of (1+8) evolutionary algorithm is a better choice for more compact circuits.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the optimization of FSMs using CGP. However, it lacks a detailed discussion of the potential limitations or challenges associated with the proposed method. Additionally, the article could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with other existing optimization techniques for FSMs. Further research could focus on extending the proposed method to design and optimize more complex sequential circuits in terms of power, cost, size, and propagation delay. Additionally, evaluating different CGP parameters to achieve the required optimization goals could enhance the applicability of the proposed approach.
