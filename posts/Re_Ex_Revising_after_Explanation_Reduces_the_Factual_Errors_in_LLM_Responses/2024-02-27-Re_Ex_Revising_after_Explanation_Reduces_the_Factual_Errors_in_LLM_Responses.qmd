### **Summary:**
- Mitigating hallucination issues in LLMs is a significant challenge.
- Re-Ex is a method proposed to revise LLM-generated texts by introducing a factual error explanation step.
- The method involves using external tools to identify factual errors, instructing LLMs to explain problematic parts, and revising the response based on the explanation.

### Major Findings:
1. Re-Ex introduces a novel factual error explanation step to revise LLM-generated texts.
2. The method outperforms existing methods such as Factool, CoVE, and RARR in terms of revision performance, time, and token efficiency.
3. New prompting techniques are proposed to reduce the time and tokens required for the response revision process.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study focuses on revising LLM-generated texts but does not address the underlying causes of factual errors in LLM responses.
- The effectiveness of the method is evaluated based on benchmarks, but the real-world applicability and generalizability of the findings are not thoroughly discussed.
- The proposed method may require further validation and testing in diverse real-world scenarios to assess its reliability and robustness.
