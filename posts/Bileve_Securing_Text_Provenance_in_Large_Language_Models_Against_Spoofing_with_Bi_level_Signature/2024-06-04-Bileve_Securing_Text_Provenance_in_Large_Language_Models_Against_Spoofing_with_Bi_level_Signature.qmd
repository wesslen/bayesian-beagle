# Summary:

The paper introduces a novel bi-level signature scheme, Bileve, to secure text provenance in large language models (LLMs) against spoofing attacks. Bileve embeds fine-grained signature bits for integrity checks and a coarse-grained signal to trace text sources when the signature is invalid. The experiments conducted on OPT-1.3B and LLaMA-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of Bileve in defeating spoofing attacks with enhanced detectability.

## Major Findings:

1. Bileve introduces a bi-level signature scheme that embeds fine-grained signature bits for integrity checks and a coarse-grained signal to trace text sources when the signature is invalid.
2. The experiments conducted on OPT-1.3B and LLaMA-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of Bileve in defeating spoofing attacks with enhanced detectability.
3. Bileve can differentiate 5 scenarios during detection, reliably tracing text provenance and regulating LLMs.

## Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of Bileve with other existing watermarking techniques, which could have helped in understanding its advantages and limitations better.
2. The paper does not discuss the potential impact of Bileve on the performance of LLMs, such as the computational overhead or the effect on the quality of generated text.
3. The paper does not discuss the potential ethical implications of using Bileve, such as the potential for misuse or the impact on user privacy.
4. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the potential vulnerabilities of Bileve, such as the possibility of an attacker bypassing the signature checks or the potential for collusion between multiple attackers.
5. The paper does not discuss the potential scalability issues of Bileve, such as the feasibility of implementing it in large-scale LLMs or the potential impact on the training process.
