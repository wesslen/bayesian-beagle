### Major Findings

1. **Dialects and NLP**: The survey examines the impact of dialects on the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models, highlighting the need to address dialectic variations in training and evaluating language technologies for equitable and fair outcomes.

2. **Challenges in Handling Dialects**: Linguistic challenges posed by dialects include differences in syntax, vocabulary, and pragmatic strategies, which significantly influence NLP tasks. Dialectic differences can be substantial, making careful attention to each dialect crucial for effective representation in NLP.

3. **Implications for Fair and Equitable Technologies**: The survey discusses how NLP performance for dialects of a language can lead to disparities in areas such as healthcare monitoring and racial biases in hate speech detection, emphasizing the importance of fair and equitable NLP approaches.

### Introduction and Scope

- NLP encompasses natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks, often relying on large language models (LLMs) based on Transformer architecture.
- The survey aims to fill the gap in understanding past work in NLP techniques for dialects of a language, covering a wide range of languages and tasks.

### Motivation

1. **Linguistic Challenges Posed by Dialects**: The survey explores linguistic variations in dialects and their impact on NLP tasks, highlighting differences in syntax, vocabulary, and pragmatic strategies.
   
2. **Rethinking LLM Benchmarks**: The survey emphasizes the need to reevaluate benchmarks used to train and evaluate language models, considering the vast diversity in dialects and the potential performance disparities in NLP tasks.

3. **Fair and Equitable Technologies**: The survey discusses the social and ethical implications of NLP performance for dialects, such as disparities in healthcare monitoring and racial biases in hate speech detection.

### Critique

The survey provides valuable insights into the impact of dialects on NLP performance and the implications for fair and equitable language technologies. However, some potential limitations and issues to consider include:

- Lack of detailed analysis: While the survey highlights the challenges posed by dialects, a more in-depth analysis of specific NLP techniques and their performance on dialects could further enrich the discussion.
- Need for practical recommendations: The survey could benefit from offering practical recommendations for addressing the identified disparities and challenges in NLP for dialects, providing actionable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field.
- Incorporating real-world examples: Including case studies or real-world examples illustrating the practical implications of dialectic variations in NLP would enhance the survey's relevance and applicability.

Overall, while the survey provides a comprehensive overview, addressing these critiques could further enhance its contribution to advancing equitable and effective NLP for dialects of different languages.
