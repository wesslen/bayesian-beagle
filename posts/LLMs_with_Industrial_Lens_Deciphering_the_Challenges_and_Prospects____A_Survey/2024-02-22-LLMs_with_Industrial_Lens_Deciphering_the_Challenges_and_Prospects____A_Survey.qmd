### **Summary:**
- Large language models (LLMs) have become widely adopted in various industrial applications, but there is a lack of standardized studies focused on their practical utilization in industry.
- A case study tailored for industry practitioners was conducted to understand the current state of LLMs adaption in the industry.
- The study revealed that LLM adoptions in the industry are facing critical challenges such as compute requirements, privacy concerns, and open access.

### **Major Findings:**
1. LLMs are widely utilized for standard NLP tasks, code generation tasks, building tools and frameworks, but there is less focus on security and societal impact related applications.
2. The study observed that advanced NLP capabilities and state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of applications are the major advantages of LLMs.
3. The survey includes the analysis of various datasets, methods, evaluation metrics, corresponding limitations relevant to industrial applications, and outlines future directions to utilize LLMs for industrial applications.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The study raises concerns about the potential privacy risks, infrastructure requirements, and the need to control the level of AI proactivity when deploying LLMs in industrial applications.
- The survey highlights the challenges faced in emotional support and long-term memory, and the lack of focus on privacy and security aspects in LLM applications.
- The study emphasizes the need for high-quality, labeled datasets, and the challenges in maximizing LLMsâ€™ potential in healthcare, retail, and finance.
