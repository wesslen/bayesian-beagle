### **Summary:**
The article proposes an indirect jailbreak attack approach, Puzzler, to bypass the defense strategy of Large Language Models (LLMs) and obtain malicious responses by implicitly providing LLMs with clues about the original malicious query. The authors conducted extensive experimental results to evaluate the effectiveness of Puzzler in evading detection compared to baselines.

### Major Findings:
1. **Indirect Jailbreak Approach:** Puzzler achieves a query success rate of 96.6% on closed-source LLMs, which is significantly higher than baselines.
2. **Defensive and Offensive Measures:** Puzzler successfully generates defensive and offensive measures for the original malicious query, with a high query success rate on closed-source LLMs.
3. **Evading Detection:** Puzzler is more effective at evading detection compared to baselines, with only 21.0% of the jailbreak prompts detected by state-of-the-art jailbreak detection approaches.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study demonstrates the effectiveness of Puzzler in bypassing LLMs' defense strategies and evading detection.
- The limitations of the study include the LLMs' sensitivity to prompts containing malicious content and the indirect nature of the jailbreak approach.
- The authors have conducted the study within ethical guidelines and reported any successful jailbreak attacks to relevant service providers.

Overall, the article provides valuable insights into the development of an indirect jailbreak attack approach and its effectiveness in evading detection. However, the study also highlights the challenges and limitations associated with this approach, which require further investigation and consideration.
