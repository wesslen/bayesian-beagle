### **Summary:**
- The paper focuses on enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to listen to speaking styles and respond properly in spoken conversations.
- The authors propose the Spoken-LLM framework to model linguistic content and speaking styles, and train it using the StyleTalk dataset.
- Spoken-LLM outperforms text-only baselines and prior speech LLMs methods based on extensive experiments.

### **Major Findings:**
1. Spoken-LLM outperforms text-only baselines and prior speech LLMs methods based on extensive experiments.
2. The StyleTalk dataset is the first spoken conversation benchmark with the same dialogue context and input sentence in different speaking styles, accompanied by corresponding expressive spoken responses for speech-to-speech modeling.
3. The proposed Spoken-LLM framework can model linguistic content and speaking styles, and is trained using the StyleTalk dataset.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The paper provides a comprehensive approach to modeling speaking styles in spoken dialogue, but it has some limitations:
  - The current StyleTalk training set consists of only around 2K samples, which may lead to training instability and overfitting.
  - The speech data in StyleTalk is synthesized from the Azure TTS system with style control, but incorporating spontaneous speech with even more diverse styles is preferable.
  - Future work should consider modeling with more than one response style for better performance and evaluation.

Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of spoken dialogue modeling, but further research is needed to address the identified limitations.
