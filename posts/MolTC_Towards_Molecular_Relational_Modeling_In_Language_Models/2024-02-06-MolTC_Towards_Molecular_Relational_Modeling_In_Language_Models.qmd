### Summary:
The article "MolTC: Towards Molecular Relational Modeling In Language Models" proposes a novel LLM-based multi-modal framework for Molecular inTeraction prediction following Chain-of-Thought (CoT) theory, termed MolTC. The framework aims to efficiently integrate rich graphical information of molecular pairs and develop a dynamic parameter-sharing strategy for cross-dataset information exchange. The experiments conducted across twelve varied datasets demonstrate the superiority of MolTC over current GNN and LLM-based baselines.

### Major Findings:
1. **MolTC Framework**: The proposed MolTC framework efficiently integrates rich graphical information of molecular pairs and develops a dynamic parameter-sharing strategy for cross-dataset information exchange.
2. **Superiority Over Baselines**: Experiments conducted across twelve varied datasets demonstrate the superiority of MolTC over current GNN and LLM-based baselines.
3. **Unified MRL**: MolTC innovatively develops a dynamic parameter-sharing strategy for cross-dataset information exchange and introduces a Multi-hierarchical CoT principle to refine the training paradigm.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The proposed MolTC framework demonstrates superior performance over current GNN and LLM-based baselines, showcasing its potential for efficient and effective molecular relational modeling.
- The article provides a comprehensive dataset, MoT-instructions, for the development of biochemical LLMs, including MolTC, with enhanced MRL performance.
- However, the study has not been subjected to datasets comprising exceptionally large or multiple molecules, which represent extreme cases. Further evaluation in few-shot or zero-shot learning scenarios is necessary to validate the proposed framework's robustness.
- The article does not address potential biases or ethical considerations related to the use of large language models in biochemical research, which could be a potential limitation. Further research is needed to explore these aspects.
