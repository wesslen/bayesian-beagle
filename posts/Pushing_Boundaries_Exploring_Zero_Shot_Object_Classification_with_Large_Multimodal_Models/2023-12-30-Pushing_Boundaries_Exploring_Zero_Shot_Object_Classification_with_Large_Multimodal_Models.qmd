### Major Findings

1. **Large Multimodal Models** (LMMs) exhibit remarkable performance in **zero-shot learning** for image classification tasks, achieving accuracies of 85%, 100%, 77%, and 79% for diverse datasets (MNIST, Cats Vs. Dogs, Hymnoptera, Pox Vs. Non-Pox skin images) without any fine-tuning.
2. Post fine-tuning for specific tasks, such as classifying images of faces of children with and without autism, the model’s accuracy significantly improved from 55% to 83%.
3. The study highlights the transformative potential of **Large Language and Vision Assistant models** (LLVAs) and their versatile applications in real-world scenarios.

### Introduction
