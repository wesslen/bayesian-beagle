### Summary:
The article introduces a novel machine-generated text (MGT) detector, Pecola, which addresses the limitations of the existing DetectGPT method. Pecola utilizes selective strategy perturbation and multi-pair contrastive learning to improve the performance of MGT detection. The experiments demonstrate that Pecola outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 1.20% in accuracy on average on four public datasets. The article also discusses the effectiveness, robustness, and generalization of the perturbation method.

### Major Findings:
1. **DetectGPT Limitations:**
    - DetectGPT has significant defects, including fragility in zero-shot settings, underutilization of perturbation, and random perturbation that introduces noise.
2. **Pecola Methodology:**
    - Pecola introduces selective strategy perturbation and token-level weighted multi-pairwise contrastive learning to address the limitations of DetectGPT.
3. **Performance Comparison:**
    - Pecola outperforms the competitors on all datasets in the few-shot MGT detection task, demonstrating its effectiveness, robustness, and generalization.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article provides a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of the existing DetectGPT method and proposes an innovative solution, Pecola, to improve MGT detection. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Pecola in addressing the limitations of DetectGPT and outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. However, the article could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential ethical considerations and future applications of the proposed method. Additionally, further research is needed to address the limitations of Pecola in detecting shorter texts and to explore its applicability in other domains and genres.
