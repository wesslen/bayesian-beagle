Agent-Pro is Better at Handling the Uncertainties of the Environment.

Figure F1: Some cases for Texas Hold'em by ReAct and Agent-Pro using GPT-4. ReAct's behavioral strategies are too aggressive, while Agent-Pro guesses the opponents' next moves and makes reasoned decisions.

ReAct is Aggressive, While Agent-Pro is More Rational.

Figure F2: Some cases for Texas Hold'em by ReAct and Agent-Pro using GPT-4. ReAct doesn't consider the risk of losing chips, while Agent-Pro is more cautious and folds when necessary.

Agent-Pro Can Better Understand the Rules of the Game.

Figure F3: Some cases for Texas Hold'em conducted by ReAct and Agent-Pro using GPT-4. ReAct does not accurately understand the rules of the game, while Agent-Pro accurately understands the rules and makes rational decisions.

Agent-Pro can Better Understand the Rules of the Game.

Figure F4: Some cases for Texas Hold'em by ReAct and Agent-Pro using GPT-4. Agent-Pro accurately understands the rules of the game and makes rational decisions, while ReAct struggles to understand the game dynamics.
