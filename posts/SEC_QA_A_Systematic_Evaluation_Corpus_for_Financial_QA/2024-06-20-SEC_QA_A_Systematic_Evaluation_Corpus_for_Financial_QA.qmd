### Summary:

The paper introduces SEC-QA, a framework for generating financial Multi Document Questions and Answers (MDQA). The framework aims to address the challenges faced by Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling multi-document long-context questions in the financial domain. The authors propose a system based on program-of-thought that improves complex information retrieval and quantitative reasoning pipelines, thereby increasing QA accuracy.

### Major Findings:

1. The SEC-QA framework allows for the customization of questions at the needed complexity for target applications, including multiple entities/financial periods, multi-hop reasoning, document structure, collection structure, and multiple outputs.
2. The framework leverages Internet-accessible document collections and open tabular databases to create real-world complex quantitative questions in finance.
3. The authors evaluate four RAG-based systems and show that RAG systems systematically fail on these carefully designed real-world questions.
4. Recent LLMs can use code to effectively navigate the structure of the document collections, leading to drastically improved levels of performance.
5. The framework can be used to dynamically refresh the benchmarks regularly to prevent training data leakage.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The paper addresses the limitations of existing datasets, which are often constrained by size, context, or relevance to practical applications.
2. The proposed framework allows for the generation of complex, practical questions grounded in the financial domain, which current RAG approaches consistently fail to answer.
3. The authors propose a method based on program-of-thought and RAG designed to enhance retrieval and downstream performance compared to conventional RAG systems.
4. The paper assumes the existence of a collectible set of documents, a tabular dataset of financial metrics, and a method to map these financial metrics to the documents. This assumption may not hold in the public sector, where reports often vary significantly due to inconsistencies in reporting standards.
5. The paper does not recommend using the proposed systems as a replacement for traditional financial analysis tools and financial advice.
6. The paper does not discuss the potential biases or ethical considerations that may arise from using the proposed framework.
7. The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the proposed framework with other existing methods for generating financial MDQ
