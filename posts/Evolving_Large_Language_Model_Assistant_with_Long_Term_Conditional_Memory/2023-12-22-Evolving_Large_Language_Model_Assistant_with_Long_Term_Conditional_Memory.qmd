### Evolving Large Language Model Assistant with Long-Term Conditional Memory

#### Key Findings

- The paper introduces an evolving large language model assistant that utilizes **verbal long-term memory** from previous dialogues to improve future responses.
- The model introduces a new memorizing mechanism called **conditional memory** to solve the limitations of previous methods and explores different ways of constructing memory.
- The paper evaluates the model on three constructed test datasets focusing on different abilities required by an AI assistant with long-term memory.

#### Introduction
- Large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have gained significant popularity and are widely used in natural language processing tasks such as chit-chat and providing assistance to users.
- The main problem for current AI assistants is the lack of long-term memory from previous dialogues, preventing them from improving the quality of their responses.

#### Framework of the Evolving LLM Assistant

- The evolving LLM assistant consists of an LLM, a memory, and a prompt-based wrapper conducting interactions between the assistant and the memory.
- The wrapper utilizes the ongoing dialogue and LLM assistant to construct memory records and store them in the memory, which are later used to improve response generation.

#### Related Work

- The paper discusses retrieval-based dialogue systems and how they have been extended to LLM-based chatbots augmented by retrieval.

#### Method

- The construction of memory involves three distinct memory types: history-based memory, summary-based memory, and **conditional memory**, which is proposed in this paper.
- The retrieval and use of memory records in response generation is achieved through a dense retrieval model and **self-reflection mechanism** for memory retrieval.

#### Dataset

- The paper constructs three test datasets to test the modelâ€™s abilities in learning from dialogue history, continuing previous dialogue, and learning from human feedback.

#### Experiment

- The experiment results show that **conditional memory** achieves the best performance among the three forms of memory.
- The combination of **conditional memory** and **summary-based memory** can improve the performance of the model.
- The **self-reflection retrieval** mechanism is effective, especially for **summary-based memory**, improving the accuracy of retrieved memory records.

#### Critique

- The paper lacks a detailed discussion of the potential limitations and challenges of using conditional memory in real-world applications.
- The study's evaluation is limited to automated evaluations and may benefit from human evaluations to validate the practical utility of the proposed assistant.
