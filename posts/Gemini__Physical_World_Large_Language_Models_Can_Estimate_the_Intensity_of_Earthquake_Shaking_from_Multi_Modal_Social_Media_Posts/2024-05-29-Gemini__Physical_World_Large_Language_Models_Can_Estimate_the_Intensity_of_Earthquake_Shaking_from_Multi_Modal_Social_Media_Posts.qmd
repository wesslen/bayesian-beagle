### Summary:

The paper presents a novel approach for estimating ground shaking intensity using social media data and CCTV footage. The study employs the Gemini 1.5 Pro model, a multi-modal language model, to extract relevant information from unstructured data. The model's output, in the form of Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) values, aligns well with independent observational data. The results suggest that Gemini utilizes a simplified understanding of the relationship between earthquake magnitude, distance, and MMI intensity, which it presumably acquired during its training. These findings raise intriguing questions about Gemini's general understanding of the physical world and its phenomena. The study highlights the potential of LLMs like Gemini in augmenting our understanding of complex physical phenomena such as earthquakes and improving citizen seismology by enabling rapid, effective, and flexible analysis of crowdsourced data.

### Major Findings:

1. The Gemini 1.5 Pro model can estimate ground shaking intensity from social media data and CCTV footage with a comparable variability to the estimates based on conventional felt reports and instrumental measurements.
2. Gemini's advanced understanding of language, images, video, and audio allows it to retain detailed and relevant information from the input data, but its capabilities are not without limitations and can be prone to errors due to factors such as low-quality inputs, limited evidence, and the presence of noise.
3. Beyond its information extraction and understanding abilities, Gemini appears to utilize additional sources of knowledge, presumably acquired during its training, in its reasoning and decision-making processes.
4. Gemini's ability to generate results consistent with established scientific knowledge highlights the potential of LLMs like Gemini in augmenting our understanding of complex physical phenomena such as earthquakes.

### Analysis and Critique:

The study presents an innovative approach to estimating ground shaking intensity using social media data and CCTV footage. The use of the Gemini 1.5 Pro model demonstrates the potential of LLMs in extracting relevant information from unstructured data and generating results consistent with established scientific knowledge. However, the study also highlights the limitations and potential biases of LLMs, such as their sensitivity to the input prompt and the high variability of inference outputs. The study could benefit from further investigation into the
