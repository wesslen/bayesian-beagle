### Summary:

The paper introduces MediQ, a framework designed to improve clinical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by simulating realistic medical consultations. The framework consists of a Patient system and an adaptive Expert system that interacts with the Patient to perform clinical reasoning. The authors develop a reliable Patient system that interacts with any Expert system, evaluating the Expert's medical information-seeking and clinical reasoning abilities. The study reveals that state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama-3-Instruct and GPT-4, struggle with proactive information seeking, highlighting a significant gap in this area. The authors also present MediQ-Expert, their best Expert system with novel abstaining capabilities to reduce unconfident answers, partially closing the gap between the realistic incomplete information setup and the existing full information setup.

### Major Findings:

1. The MediQ framework is introduced, which simulates realistic medical consultations with modular components to improve clinical reasoning in LLMs.
2. A reliable Patient system is developed that interacts with any Expert system, evaluating the Expert's medical information-seeking and clinical reasoning abilities.
3. State-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama-3-Instruct and GPT-4, struggle with proactive information seeking, revealing a significant gap in this area.
4. MediQ-Expert, the best Expert system with novel abstaining capabilities, is developed to partially close the gap between the realistic incomplete information setup and the existing full information setup.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel problem towards LLM reliability, a novel MediQ framework, and highlights important future directions to extend the information-seeking abilities of LLM assistants in critical domains. However, the study has some limitations. The scarcity of datasets containing detailed patient information sufficient for a medical diagnosis is a significant challenge. Additionally, the Patient system in the benchmark relies on a paid API, and the evaluation framework is limited to the multiple-choice format. Future work should establish an open-source Patient and expand the MediQ framework to open-ended medical consultations.

The paper also raises ethical concerns, as the MediQ framework is
