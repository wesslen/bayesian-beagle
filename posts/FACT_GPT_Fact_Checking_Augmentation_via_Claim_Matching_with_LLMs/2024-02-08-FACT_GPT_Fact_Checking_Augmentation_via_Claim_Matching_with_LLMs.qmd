### **Summary:**
- FACT-GPT is a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the claim matching stage of fact-checking.
- The system is trained on a synthetic dataset and can identify social media content that aligns with, contradicts, or is irrelevant to previously debunked claims.
- The evaluation shows that FACT-GPT can match the accuracy of larger models in identifying related claims, closely mirroring human judgment.

### Major Findings:
1. The urgent need for extensive fact-checking has been driven by the rapid proliferation of misinformation on digital platforms.
2. Claim matching is important for the early detection of misinformation, content moderation, and automated debunking.
3. Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to effectively match claims and benefit fact-checkers by minimizing redundant verification.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study emphasizes the potential of LLMs in augmenting the fact-checking process, particularly during the claim matching phase.
- The models excel in detecting whether social media content is relevant to or irrelevant from debunked claims but struggle with categorizing posts that contradict these claims.
- Completely automating fact-checking procedures using AI carries certain risks and limitations, such as the perpetuation of biases intrinsic to models and inherent inconsistencies due to their probabilistic nature.
- Future studies should focus on discovering different methods for data synthesis and augmentation to further optimize FACT-GPT and evaluating the modelâ€™s performance across a variety of real-world datasets.
