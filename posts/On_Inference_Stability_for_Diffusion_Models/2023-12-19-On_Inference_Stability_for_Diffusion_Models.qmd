### Summary of "On Inference Stability for Diffusion Models"

#### Key Findings
1. **Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs)** have shown to be effective in generating high-quality images, but they suffer from slow sampling speed and lack of correlation between timesteps. The proposed **sequence-aware loss** technique significantly improves image generalization quality on various benchmark datasets.
  
2. Existing approaches focusing on accelerating the generation process by applying non-Markovian diffusion processes or utilizing higher-order solvers for ordinary differential equations can be complemented with the proposed method to achieve even better image quality.

3. The study introduces a theoretical connection between the denoising process and solving ordinary differential equations, leading to the development of the sequence-aware loss that noticeably enhances the estimation gap and ultimately improves the sampling quality in DPMs.

### Introduction
- **Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs)** are effective generative models. However, they suffer from slow sampling speed, and correlation between timesteps is often neglected.
- Prior methods have focused on accelerating the generation process and refining inefficient sampling trajectories.

### Background
- DPMs consist of a forward process that adds noise to the original data distribution and a reverse process that reconstructs a data instance from the noises.
- Various attempts to refine inefficient sampling trajectories have been made, including estimating the optimal variance to correct potential bias caused by imperfect mean estimation.

### Methodology
- The study identifies the **estimation gap** between predicted and actual sampling trajectories and introduces a novel **sequence-aware loss** to minimize this gap.
- The proposed loss function is theoretically proven to be a tighter upper bound of the estimation gap compared to conventional loss functions in DPMs.

### Experiments
- Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in **FID** (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) and **Inception Score** when employing the sequence-aware loss in multiple DPM frameworks on various benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ.
- The proposed loss function shows promise in accelerating the sampling process and enhancing image quality, both individually and in combination with advanced techniques.

### Critique
- The proposed sequence-aware loss function requires calculation of the network's output at multiple timesteps, resulting in longer training times compared to conventional loss functions.
- The study focuses on image quality metrics, and additional evaluation on other aspects, such as model robustness and scalability, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed method.
