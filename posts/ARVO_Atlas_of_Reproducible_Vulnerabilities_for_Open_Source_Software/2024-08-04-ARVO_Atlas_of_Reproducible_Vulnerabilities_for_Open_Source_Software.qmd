**Summary:**

- The paper introduces ARVO, an Atlas of Reproducible Vulnerabilities in Open-source software, which aims to address the shortage of research vulnerability datasets.
- ARVO is a framework that automatically identifies the correct patch commit from OSS-Fuzz projects and automatically builds a reproducible environment for the vulnerable software system.
- The ARVO dataset contains over 5,000 real-world vulnerabilities in open source C/C++ projects, which can be automatically updated with new vulnerabilities with minimal manual effort.
- The paper highlights the key challenges in improving reproducibility for research vulnerability datasets and describes the methods used in ARVO to address these issues.
- The paper also presents the ARVO dataset and demonstrates that it achieves the goals of reproducibility, scalability, quality and diversity, and ease of use.

**Major Findings:**

1. ARVO successfully reproduced 5,651 out of 8,934 vulnerabilities sourced from OSS-Fuzz (63.3%), and identified the precise fix for 5,001 (88.5%) of the reproduced cases.
2. The ARVO dataset is the only dataset to achieve reproducibility on a large scale, with a success rate of over 80% in locating patches.
3. The ARVO dataset is unique in its combination of size and bug reproducibility, with complete support for project recompilation for all bug cases at the scale provided.

**Analysis and Critique:**

- The paper provides a thorough characterization of the ARVO dataset and demonstrates its value for future research through two case studies.
- The paper highlights the limitations of ARVO, including its reliance on bisection for identifying vulnerability fixes, which may not always accurately pinpoint the exact fix.
- The paper also notes that the ARVO dataset can include duplicated bugs from OSS-Fuzz, where OSS-Fuzz has reported two (or more) vulnerabilities that share a single underlying root cause.
- The paper acknowledges that building and reproducing historical vulnerabilities can be challenging due to the "bit rot" of their associated dependencies, resources, and toolchains.
- The paper concludes
