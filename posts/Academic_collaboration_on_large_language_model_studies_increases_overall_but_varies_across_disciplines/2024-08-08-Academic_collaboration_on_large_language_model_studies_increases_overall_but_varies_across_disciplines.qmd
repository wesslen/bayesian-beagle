### Summary:

- The study explores the application of large language models (LLMs) in scientific disciplines and their implications for interdisciplinary collaboration.
- The authors collect and analyze 50,391 papers from OpenAlex, an open-source platform for scholarly metadata.
- The study reveals that most fields have exhibited varying degrees of increased entropy following the release of ChatGPT, with Computer Science displaying a consistent increase.
- Other fields such as Social Science, Decision Science, Psychology, Engineering, Health Professions, and Business, Management & Accounting have shown minor to significant increases in entropy in 2024 compared to 2023.
- Statistical testing further indicates that the entropy in Computer Science, Decision Science, and Engineering is significantly lower than that in health-related fields like Medicine and Biochemistry, Genetics & Molecular Biology.
- The network analysis based on authors’ affiliation information highlights the prominence of Computer Science, Medicine, and other Computer Science-related departments in LLM research.
- Regarding authors’ institutions, the analysis reveals that entities such as Stanford University, Harvard University, University College London, and Google are key players, either dominating centrality measures or playing crucial roles in connecting research networks.
- The study provides valuable insights into the current landscape and evolving dynamics of collaboration networks in LLM research.
- The findings suggest potential areas for fostering more diverse collaborations and highlight the need for continued research on the impact of LLMs on scientific research practices and outcomes.
