### Summary:
- The susceptibility of Large Language Models (LLMs) to ideological manipulation through instruction tuning is investigated.
- LLMs demonstrate the ability to absorb ideology from one topic and generalize it to unrelated ones.
- Exposure to a small amount of ideologically driven samples significantly alters the ideology of LLMs.
- Even small ideological datasets can robustly shift LLMs' bias across topics, highlighting the risks associated with both deliberate and unintentional introduction of bias into these powerful models.

### Major Findings:
1. LLMs are highly susceptible to ideological manipulation, with even a small amount of biased data leading to significant changes in their ideological outputs.
2. Ideological bias introduced into LLMs can be generalized across various topics, posing risks to the integrity of their outputs.
3. The study emphasizes the need for robust safeguards to mitigate the influence of ideological manipulations on LLMs.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The findings underscore the risks associated with intentionally poisoned training data by malicious actors or inadvertently introduced biases by data annotators.
- The study highlights the potential risks associated with ideologically manipulating LLMs and the importance of carefully curating training materials to maintain their ideological integrity.
- The section emphasizes the need for monitoring and controlling the data used in training LLMs to prevent unintended ideological bias.
- The study's U.S.-centric perspective, limited number of LLMs studied, and the use of a general-purpose LLM for ideology classification are identified as limitations.
- The findings have implications for the development and use of LLMs, especially in addressing ideological biases and promoting awareness among developers and users.
