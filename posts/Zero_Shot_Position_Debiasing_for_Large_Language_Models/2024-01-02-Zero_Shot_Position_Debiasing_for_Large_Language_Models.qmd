# Zero-Shot Position Debiasing for Large Language Models

## Summary
The paper presents a **zero-shot position debiasing (ZOE) framework** to mitigate position bias in large language models (LLMs) without any external knowledge or datasets. ZOE leverages low-bias inference and a master-slave alignment (MSA) module to collect and prune unsupervised responses and applies multi-objective optimization for fine-tuning. Experimental results show that ZOE outperforms existing methods in mitigating position biases for generative tasks, sacrificing only a small performance on biased samples.

### Major Findings
1. **ZOE** consistently outperforms existing methods in mitigating position biases for generative tasks without the need for external bias knowledge or non-biased samples.
2. The framework achieves this by leveraging low-bias unsupervised responses and pruning low-quality responses with the **MSA module**.
3. ZOE mitigates various types of position biases by sacrificing only small performance on biased samples, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization.

### Preliminary
- Large language models (LLMs) exhibit poor generalization performance due to dataset biases and artifacts, particularly in position bias.
- Existing debiasing methods for LLMs often rely on external bias knowledge or manually annotated non-biased samples, which is impractical for position bias.
- The proposed ZOE framework leverages pre-trained LLMs' low position bias characteristics for debiasing in a zero-shot setting.

### Model
- The **ZOE framework** consists of three parts: low-bias inference, MSA, and multi-objective optimization, all without requiring external bias knowledge or non-biased datasets.
- **Low-bias inference** generates unsupervised low-bias responses based on pre-trained LLMs through diverse prompting strategies.
- The **MSA module** prunes unsupervised responses to align them with the target responses to mitigate position bias.
- **Multi-objective optimization** fine-tunes the model by optimizing target responses and aligned unsupervised responses.

### Experiments
- ZOE is evaluated on five tasks with eight datasets and consistently outperforms existing methods in mitigating three types of position biases.
- The framework sacrifices only a small performance on biased samples, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization across tasks and datasets.

## Critique
The paper effectively introduces the ZOE framework for mitigating position bias in LLMs and supports its effectiveness through extensive experiments. However, the paper could benefit from additional discussions or experiments regarding potential limitations or drawbacks of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the paper would benefit from more thorough analysis of the ethical considerations associated with the use of dialogue systems and language models.
