### Summary:

The paper presents a framework called HardEval for assessing the difficulty of code generation tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework aims to identify hard tasks within existing benchmarks and generate more hard tasks for evaluation or improvement of LLMs. HardEval uses a diverse array of prompts for a single task across multiple LLMs to obtain a difficulty score for each task in a benchmark. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of HardEval using two code generation benchmarks, HumanEval+ and ClassEval, and show that it can reliably identify hard tasks within those benchmarks. The paper also discusses the practical hard task topics identified and how they can be used to generate new hard tasks.

### Major Findings:

1. HardEval can reliably identify hard tasks within existing benchmarks, highlighting that only 21% for HumanEval+ and 27% for ClassEval of the tasks are hard for LLMs.
2. The analysis of task difficulty reveals six practical hard task topics, which can be used to generate new hard tasks.
3. The difficulty score proposed in HardEval can be used to identify hard tasks within existing benchmarks, which can then be leveraged to generate more hard tasks centered around specific topics either for evaluation or improvement of LLMs.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents an innovative approach to assessing the difficulty of code generation tasks for LLMs. The HardEval framework provides a systematic way to identify hard tasks within existing benchmarks and generate new hard tasks. However, the paper does not discuss the limitations or potential biases of the framework. It would be helpful to understand how the framework handles tasks with varying levels of complexity and how it accounts for the differences in LLM architectures and training data. Additionally, the paper does not provide a comparison of HardEval with other existing methods for assessing task difficulty. It would be useful to see how HardEval compares to other approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

Overall, the paper presents a promising approach to assessing the difficulty of code generation tasks for LLMs. The HardEval framework has the potential to improve the evaluation and improvement of LLMs by providing a more fine-grained analysis of individual tasks within a benchmark. However, further research is needed to address the limitations and potential biases of the framework and to compare it with other existing methods.
