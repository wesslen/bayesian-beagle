**Summary:**

The paper introduces RedAgent, a multi-agent language model system designed to generate context-aware jailbreak prompts for testing the security of large language models (LLMs). The system leverages a concept called "jailbreak strategy" to model existing attacks and improve the efficiency of red teaming methods. RedAgent can jailbreak most black-box LLMs within five queries, improving the efficiency of existing red teaming methods by two times. The system can also jailbreak customized LLM applications more efficiently, discovering 60 severe vulnerabilities in real-world applications with only two queries per vulnerability.

**Major Findings:**

1. RedAgent can jailbreak most black-box LLMs within five queries, improving the efficiency of existing red teaming methods by two times.
2. The system can jailbreak customized LLM applications more efficiently, discovering 60 severe vulnerabilities in real-world applications with only two queries per vulnerability.
3. LLM applications enhanced with external data or tools are more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks than foundation models.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The paper presents an innovative approach to testing the security of LLMs by generating context-aware jailbreak prompts. The use of a multi-agent language model system and the concept of "jailbreak strategy" are promising developments in the field of LLM security. However, the paper does not discuss the potential risks associated with using such a system, such as the possibility of malicious actors using it to exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of the system or the potential biases that may be introduced during the red teaming process. Further research is needed to address these concerns and ensure the responsible use of such systems.
