# Prompting LLMs with Content Plans to Enhance Summarization of Scientific Articles

## Summary
This paper introduces novel prompting techniques to improve the performance of automatic summarization systems for scientific articles, which are often challenging due to their complexity and length. The paper evaluates various prompting techniques and their impact on different summarization models and input texts. The results show performance gains, particularly for smaller models summarizing sections separately. The findings introduce a new research direction of using prompts to aid smaller models in summarizing scientific articles.

## Findings
1. **Challenges of Scientific Article Summarization**: Scientific articles pose difficulties for summarization due to their length, technical vocabulary, complex structures, and irregular organizational formats. This makes summarization challenging for even state-of-the-art natural language processing systems.
2. **Effectiveness of Prompting Techniques**: The paper proposes and evaluates five prompting techniques, showing consistent performance improvements from prompting techniques on smaller models, especially when summarizing sections independently. Smaller models exhibit increases in ROUGE-1 score around 0.1-0.4 when aided by prompts. The results suggest that prompting is an effective approach for overcoming the limitations of smaller summarization systems.
3. **Implications of the Findings**: The findings suggest that prompting techniques enhance the focus of summarization models on core concepts, especially for smaller models, indicating the potential of prompts to aid smaller models in resource-constrained contexts like mobile devices.

## Critique
The paper provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of prompting techniques for scientific article summarization. However, the study primarily focuses on model performance metrics and lacks a comprehensive analysis of the semantic quality of the summaries generated. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from discussing potential limitations and challenges in the practical implementation of the proposed prompting techniques. This could include addressing how the approach handles ambiguous or polysemous terms and potential biases in the extraction of key terms from scientific articles. Additionally, the paper could further elaborate on future research directions beyond the specific techniques evaluated in the study.
