### Summary:

- The study focuses on multi-scenario recommendation (MSR), which aims to improve recommendation performance across multiple scenarios using data from all of them.
- Existing MSR methods suffer from insufficient scenario knowledge integration and neglecting personalized cross-scenario preferences, leading to suboptimal performance and inadequate interpretability.
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown great reasoning and semantic information capturing capabilities, but their high inference latency and computation cost hinder their implementation in industrial recommender systems.
- The proposed LLM-enhanced paradigm, LLM4MSR, leverages LLM to uncover multi-level knowledge, including scenario correlations and users' cross-scenario interests, without fine-tuning the LLM.
- Hierarchical meta networks are then used to generate multi-level meta layers to improve scenario-aware and personalized recommendation capabilities.
- Experiments on three datasets show that LLM4MSR is effective, compatible with different MSR backbone models, efficient for deployment in industrial recommender systems, and improves interpretability.

### Major Findings:

1. LLM4MSR effectively integrates multi-level knowledge from LLM, including scenario correlations and users' cross-scenario interests, to improve recommendation performance across multiple scenarios.
2. The use of hierarchical meta networks in LLM4MSR enables the generation of multi-level meta layers, which enhance scenario-aware and personalized recommendation capabilities.
3. LLM4MSR is compatible with various MSR backbone models and can achieve significant improvements in AUC (1.5%, 1%, and 40% on three datasets) compared to existing methods.
4. LLM4MSR is efficient for deployment in industrial recommender systems, as it enables real-time recommendation without fine-tuning the LLM.
5. The use of LLM in LLM4MSR improves the interpretability of the recommendation process, as it provides explicit summaries of scenario commonality and distinction, as well as users' cross-scenario preferences.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The proposed LLM4MSR paradigm addresses the limitations of existing MSR methods by effectively integrating multi-level knowledge from LLM and improving scenario-aware and personalized recommendation
