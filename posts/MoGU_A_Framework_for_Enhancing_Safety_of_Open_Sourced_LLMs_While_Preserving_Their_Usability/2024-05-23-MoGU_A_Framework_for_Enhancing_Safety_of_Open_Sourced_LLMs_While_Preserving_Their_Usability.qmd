### Summary:

The paper introduces a novel framework called Mixing of Glad and Unwilling Responders (MoGU) to enhance the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) while preserving their usability. The MoGU framework transforms the base LLM into two variants: the usable LLM and the safe LLM, and employs dynamic routing to balance their contribution. When encountering malicious instructions, the router assigns a higher weight to the safe LLM to ensure harmless responses. Conversely, for benign instructions, the router prioritizes the usable LLM, facilitating usable and helpful responses. The MoGU framework is compared to multiple defense strategies on various open-sourced LLMs, demonstrating its superiority in enhancing LLMs' safety while preserving their usability.

### Major Findings:

1. The MoGU framework effectively enhances the safety of LLMs by transforming the base LLM into two variants: the usable LLM and the safe LLM, and employing dynamic routing to balance their contribution.
2. The MoGU framework outperforms existing defense strategies in preserving the usability of LLMs, as it prioritizes the usable LLM for benign instructions, facilitating usable and helpful responses.
3. The MoGU framework demonstrates superior performance in enhancing LLMs' safety while preserving their usability, as verified by its comparison to multiple defense strategies on various open-sourced LLMs.

### Analysis and Critique:

1. The MoGU framework's reliance on binary classification of instructions may struggle with arbitrary treatment, as many benign instructions may be wrongly marked as malicious, mistakenly activating the safety mechanism and thus diminishing the usability of responses to benign instructions.
2. The MoGU framework's dynamic routing mechanism has proven effective in assigning weights to experts according to the input instruction, but its effectiveness in balancing the contribution of each variant by assigning weights requires further investigation.
3. The MoGU framework's superiority in enhancing LLMs' safety while preserving their usability is demonstrated by its comparison to multiple defense strategies on various open-sourced LLMs, but its performance on other LLMs and in different contexts remains to be evaluated.
