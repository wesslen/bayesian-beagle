**Summary:**

This research aims to tackle the security and quality concerns of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. These models are increasingly utilized for software development but are primarily trained on publicly available code repositories and internet-based textual data, which may contain insecure code. This presents a significant risk of perpetuating vulnerabilities in the generated code. The research introduces a framework for secure behavioral learning of LLMs through In-Context Learning (ICL) patterns during the code generation process, followed by rigorous security evaluations. Four diverse LLMs are selected for experimentation, and their coding capabilities are evaluated across three programming languages. The research indicates that ICL-driven one-shot and few-shot learning patterns can enhance code security, reducing vulnerabilities in various programming scenarios. However, developers and researchers should be aware that LLMs have a limited understanding of security principles, which may lead to security breaches when the generated code is deployed in production systems. The research highlights that LLMs are a potential source of new vulnerabilities to the software supply chain and emphasizes the importance of considering this when using LLMs for code generation.

**Major Findings:**

1. LLMs like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, which are increasingly used for software development, are primarily trained on publicly available code repositories and internet-based textual data, which may contain insecure code. This presents a significant risk of perpetuating vulnerabilities in the generated code.
2. The research introduces a framework for secure behavioral learning of LLMs through In-Context Learning (ICL) patterns during the code generation process, followed by rigorous security evaluations. This framework is tested on four diverse LLMs across three programming languages.
3. The research indicates that ICL-driven one-shot and few-shot learning patterns can enhance code security, reducing vulnerabilities in various programming scenarios.
4. However, developers and researchers should be aware that LLMs have a limited understanding of security principles, which may lead to security breaches when the generated code is deployed in production systems.
5. The research highlights that LLMs are a potential source of new vulnerabilities to the software supply chain and emphasizes the importance of considering this when using LLMs for code generation.
