### Summary:
The article investigates the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) in distinguishing logically correct inferences from fallacious ones, focusing on inference patterns involving conditionals and epistemic modals. The study is relevant to understanding how well LLMs match human reasoning abilities. The authors tested a dozen LLMs and found that all but GPT-4 often make basic mistakes with conditionals, and even GPT-4 displays logically inconsistent judgments across inference patterns involving epistemic modals.

### Major Findings:
1. LLMs, except for GPT-4, often make basic mistakes with conditionals.
2. Even GPT-4 displays logically inconsistent judgments across inference patterns involving epistemic modals.

### Analysis and Critique:
The study provides valuable insights into the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, it has some limitations and potential biases. The article focuses on a specific set of inference patterns, and the results may not be generalizable to all types of reasoning. Additionally, the study does not compare LLMs with experimental human subjects, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of their reasoning abilities. Furthermore, the article acknowledges ongoing controversies about the correct logic of conditionals and modals, indicating the need for further research in this area. Overall, while the study sheds light on LLMs' logical reasoning, it also highlights the complexity and challenges in evaluating their reasoning abilities.
