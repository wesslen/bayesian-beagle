**Summary of the Article:**
The article discusses the recent developments in MultiModal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) and provides a comprehensive survey to facilitate further research. MM-LLMs utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to support MultiModal (MM) inputs or outputs and have shown substantial advancements in various downstream tasks. The paper outlines the model architecture, training pipeline, reviews the performance of existing MM-LLMs, and proposes promising future directions in the domain. It also introduces a dedicated website to track the latest progress and facilitate collaboration in the MM-LLMs field.

### Major Findings:
1. **Model Architecture and Training Pipeline:**
   - MM-LLMs leverage LLMs as the cognitive powerhouse and use modality encoders, input projectors, LLM backbones, output projectors, and modality generators to effectively connect models in different modalities and support collaborative inference.
   - The training pipeline consists of two stages: MM Pre-Training (PT) and MM Instruction-Tuning (IT), focusing on enhancing pre-trained text-only LLMs to support MM input or output.

2. **State-of-the-Art MM-LLMs:**
   - The article highlights several state-of-the-art MM-LLMs such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, LLaVA, MiniGPT-4, and others, outlining their core contributions and developmental trends.

3. **Training Recipes and Future Directions:**
   - The article provides insights into training recipes that boost the effectiveness of MM-LLMs, such as incorporating high-resolution images and high-quality fine-tuning datasets.
   - It proposes promising future directions for MM-LLMs, including more powerful models, challenging benchmarks, mobile/lightweight deployment, embodied intelligence, and continual instruction-tuning.

### Analysis and Critique:
The comprehensive survey and detailed overview of MM-LLMs provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field. However, the article could benefit from elaborating on the limitations and challenges associated with MM-LLMs, such as computational costs, model biases, and potential ethical considerations. Additionally, while it outlines future directions, it would be beneficial to address potential roadblocks and limitations in achieving these advancements. Overall, the article offers a thorough review of MM-LLMs but could enhance the analysis by delving further into challenges and potential biases in the development and deployment of these models.
