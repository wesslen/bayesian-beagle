mber guess) of agent i in round t, T is the total number of rounds in the game, and ρ(a)ρitalic_ρ(a) is the payoff of action a to the player. The denominator ρo⁢pitalic_ρo⁢p is the optimal payoff for the player when all players play rationally. The measure rirosso⁢psubscriptri=1T⁢∑t=1Tρ(a)ρo⁢psubscript𝑟𝑖1𝑇superscriptsubscript𝑡1𝑇𝜌subscript𝑎𝑖𝑡subscript𝜌𝑜𝑝, which is the average deviation distance from the NE, measure the rationality degree of agent i. A larger value indicates the agent acts more irrationally.
To define the 5th-grade Nash equilibrium, we should consider payoffs rather than strategies, especially in LLMs where complex strategies are often hard to interpret and characterise.


For actions of 0, 1 and 2, the payoff matrix is as follow:





ϕ1⁢(0)ϕ1⁢(1)ϕ1⁢(2)ϕ2⁢(0)11-1ϕ2⁢(1)-11ϕ2⁢(2)000,

(2)





which captures the payoffs of two players in a simple coordination game.
If a player chooses 1 and the other 2, the payoffs violate the NE condition and indicate irrationally behaving.
By taking the NE action of 1 and 2 into account, and define the respective NE payoffs to be 11, -11, -11 and 00, we can use the deviation distance measure to reflect the level of rationality.
When all players maximise their payoffs, the deviation distance is 00 throughout, and higher deviations on average mean a less rational degree.


A review of the rirosso⁢psubscriptri=1T⁢∑t=1Tρ⁢(ai⁢t)ρo⁢psubscript𝑟𝑖1𝑇superscriptsubscript𝑡1𝑇𝜌subscript𝑎𝑖𝑡subscript𝜌𝑜𝑝 measure for every agent reveals the rationality degree of several LLMs in Economics Arena.
The rationality measure provided helps in evaluating how well LLMs are able to behave in a rational and strategic manner, and in identifying which LLMs are relatively more rational in competitive settings.
