### **Summary:**
- Retrieval-augmented language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to answer subjective, contentious, and conflicting queries.
- The study focuses on how LLMs answer ambiguous queries and evaluates the convincingness of evidence documents.
- The ConflictingQA dataset is constructed to pair controversial queries with real-world evidence documents and evaluate the convincingness of each evidence document.
- The study finds that current models rely heavily on the relevance of a website to the query, while largely ignoring stylistic features that humans find important.
- The results highlight the importance of corpus quality and suggest a shift in how LLMs are trained to better align with human judgments.

### Major Findings:
1. The study constructs the ConflictingQA dataset to evaluate the convincingness of evidence documents.
2. Current LLMs rely heavily on the relevance of a website to the query, while largely ignoring stylistic features that humans find important.
3. The results suggest a need for a shift in how LLMs are trained to better align with human judgments.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The study provides valuable insights into how LLMs evaluate evidence documents, but it has limitations in fully capturing the complexity of LLM usage in practice.
- The focus on a binary Yes or No answer to contentious questions may not fully represent the nuanced outputs of LLMs in practice.
- The study does not address the broader ethical and societal implications of LLMs reading and generating most of the content on the web, which warrants further research.
