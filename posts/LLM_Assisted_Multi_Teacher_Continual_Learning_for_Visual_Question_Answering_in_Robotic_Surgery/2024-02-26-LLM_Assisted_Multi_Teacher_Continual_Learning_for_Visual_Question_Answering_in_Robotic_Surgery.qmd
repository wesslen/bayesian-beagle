### **Summary:**
- Visual question answering (VQA) is important for robotic-assisted surgical education, but continually updating the VQA system with new tasks is challenging.
- This paper proposes a multi-teacher continual learning (CL) framework that leverages a multimodal large language model (LLM) to address domain shifts and data imbalances in surgical VQA tasks.
- The paper introduces a new dataset for surgical VQA tasks and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method through extensive experimental results.

### **Major Findings:**
1. The proposed multi-teacher CL framework with LLM effectively addresses domain shifts and data imbalances in surgical VQA tasks.
2. The adaptive weight assignment approach balances the generalization ability of the LLM and the domain expertise of the old CL model, leading to compelling performance in tackling realistic surgical VQA tasks.
3. The new surgical domain VQA dataset provides a valuable resource for future research and points out a novel way to generate QA pairs with the in-context learning (ICL) technique.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The proposed method consistently outperforms other advanced CL models, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of surgical VQA tasks.
- The paper provides a detailed ablation study to demonstrate the importance of each component in the proposed method, highlighting their indispensability.
- The case study illustrates how the LLM aids in correct classification in surgical VQA tasks, emphasizing the importance of the multi-teacher CL framework with adaptive weights.
- The paper acknowledges potential future research directions, such as decomposing representations into spatial and temporal space and integrating multi-modal data to further advance performance outcomes.

Overall, the paper effectively addresses the challenges of continual learning for visual question answering in robotic surgery and provides valuable insights for future research in this domain. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in addressing domain shifts and data imbalances, contributing to the advancement of surgical VQA systems.
