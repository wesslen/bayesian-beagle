### Summary:

This paper analyzes the persuasiveness of free-text rationales generated by nine Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of pairwise argument ranking, a highly subjective task with potential real-world applications like debate assistance. The study focuses on the models' ability to provide convincing rationales for their subjective choices.

### Major Findings:

1. Open-source LLMs, particularly Llama2-70B-chat, are capable of generating highly persuasive rationalizations, surpassing even GPT models.
2. Rationale persuasiveness can be improved by controlling its parameters through prompting or through self-refinement.
3. GPT4 closely matched human rankings of the persuasiveness of the rationales, although a perfect agreement was unattainable due to the inherent subjectivity of the task.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The study's focus on subjective tasks like pairwise argument ranking is a significant contribution to the field, as most existing research has focused on tasks with expected factual ground truth answers.
- The inclusion of a large number of models and evaluation measures strengthens the study's findings.
- The study's reliance on human annotators for evaluation introduces potential subjectivity, which could be mitigated by incorporating additional factors from persuasive theory in future work.
- The relatively small annotated sample size prioritized quality control over quantity, and while the results are likely consistent with a larger sample, re-evaluation with a broader dataset would strengthen the findings.
- The study's focus on pairwise argument ranking could be expanded to other domains where the task is inherently subjective to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
- The potential ethical concern of persuasive rationales being used adversely to promote biased or nonfactual arguments should be considered, and safeguards should be developed to prevent misuse.
