### **Summary:**
- Agent-based models (ABMs) are essential for addressing complex systems and achieving various objectives.
- Large language models (LLMs) can potentially alleviate the difficulty of ABM generation, but they excel in handling sequential information, making it challenging for analyzing the intricate interactions and nonlinear dynamics inherent in ABMs.
- SAGE is a solution-oriented ABM generation framework designed for automatic modeling and generating solutions for targeted problems.

### **Major Findings:**
1. SAGE is designed to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate executable and verifiable agent-based solutions through a two-stage process.
2. The framework utilizes verifier-assisted iterative in-context learning to ensure the model executability and solution feasibility.
3. Evaluations demonstrate that SAGE leads to an average improvement of 18.7% in modeling quality and 38.1% in solution generation effectiveness.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The SAGE framework demonstrates significant improvements in ABM generation and solution effectiveness, addressing the challenges posed by traditional methods.
- The framework's reliance on large language models (LLMs) may introduce biases and limitations inherent in the underlying models.
- The iterative nature of the SAGE framework may require substantial computational resources and time, potentially limiting its scalability and practicality in real-world applications.
