### Summary:
The paper presents a comprehensive survey on the current state of research on large language models (LLMs) and their adaptation for specific scenarios through the use of personas. The authors identify two main lines of research: LLM Role-Playing and LLM Personalization. In LLM Role-Playing, LLMs are tasked to play assigned personas (i.e., roles) and act accordingly to environmental feedback. The key aspect is how LLMs adapt to defined environments. In LLM Personalization, LLMs take care of users’ personas (e.g., background information, or historical behaviors) to meet customized needs. The key aspect is how LLMs adapt to distinct users. The authors aim to close the gap in the literature by offering a systematic categorization of present studies and hope this work could serve as a beginner guide for newcomers and a practical roadmap for current researchers in the field.

### Major Findings:
1. LLM Role-Playing: LLMs can be tasked to play assigned personas and act accordingly to environmental feedback, allowing them to adapt to defined environments.
2. LLM Personalization: LLMs can take care of users’ personas to meet customized needs, allowing them to adapt to distinct users.
3. The authors present the first survey for LLM role-playing and LLM personalization under the unified view of persona.

### Analysis and Critique:
The paper provides a valuable contribution to the field by offering a comprehensive survey on the current state of research on LLMs and their adaptation for specific scenarios through the use of personas. The authors identify two main lines of research and provide a systematic categorization of present studies. However, the paper does not discuss the limitations or potential biases of the surveyed studies, nor does it provide a critical analysis of the current state of the field. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential ethical implications of using personas in LLMs, such as the potential for LLMs to perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases. Further research is needed to address these issues and to ensure that the use of personas in LLMs is done in a responsible and ethical manner.
