### Summary:

- The article explores the conflict between the values of honesty and harmlessness in the context of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values.
- Current research on aligning LLMs focuses on helpfulness and harmlessness, while honesty is often overlooked due to its unclear definition and potential trade-offs with other values.
- The authors reveal that LLMs learn to reject harmful responses as lies, which can decrease alignment robustness. They propose methods to prompt a balance between honesty and harmlessness, including post-hoc LLMs pruning and a representation regularization in Direct Performance Optimization (DPO).
- The study contributes to the understanding of AI alignment robustness and interpretability, highlighting a new alignment vulnerability and proposing a method to improve human-level AI alignment.

### Major Findings:

1. LLMs learn to reject harmful responses as lies, which can decrease alignment robustness.
2. Post-hoc LLMs pruning can slightly improve LLMs' alignment robustness on conflicting values.
3. A representation regularization in DPO can prompt a balance between honesty and harmlessness, leading to better ending performances.

### Analysis and Critique:

- The article provides a novel perspective on the conflict between honesty and harmlessness in AI alignment, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach to aligning LLMs with human values.
- The proposed methods for prompting a balance between honesty and harmlessness are promising, but further research is needed to fully understand their implications and potential limitations.
- The study's focus on LLMs' alignment with human values raises broader questions about the role of AI in society and the ethical considerations involved in AI development and deployment.
- The article's findings suggest that AI alignment is a complex and ongoing process that requires continuous research and development to ensure that AI systems behave in line with human intentions and values.
