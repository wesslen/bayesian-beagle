### Summary:

The study investigates the use of open-source large language models (OLLMs) for generating commit messages (CMs) that are comparable to those produced by the state-of-the-art Omniscient Message Generator (OMG), which uses GPT-4. The authors propose a new approach called lOcal MessagE GenerAtor (OMEGA) that employs a 4-bit quantized 8B OLLM. The study demonstrates that OMEGA can generate CMs that surpass the performance of GPT-4 in practitioners' preference.

### Major Findings:

1. An OLLM can generate CMs that are comparable to those produced by OMG, but with a gap in comprehensiveness.
2. The study introduces a new method summarization approach called Change-based Multi-Intent Method Summarization (CMMS) for software engineering tasks that rely on code changes.
3. The study proposes two augmentation techniques for commit diff, Diff Narrator and Fine-grained Interactive Diff EXplainer (FIDEX), that boost SLM's performance in CMG.
4. OMEGA, a 4-bit quantized SLM with 8B trained parameters, can generate CMs that are preferred by practitioners over those generated by OMG.

### Analysis and Critique:

The study provides a well-structured and coherent summary of the research, highlighting the major findings and contributions. The use of open-source LLMs for generating CMs is a significant contribution, as it addresses privacy and sustainability concerns associated with proprietary LLMs. The proposed OMEGA approach shows promising results in generating CMs that are preferred by practitioners over those generated by OMG.

However, the study has some limitations. The evaluation of the proposed approach is based on a single dataset, and the results may not generalize to other datasets or programming languages. Additionally, the study does not provide a detailed comparison of the proposed approach with other state-of-the-art CMG methods. The study also does not discuss the potential impact of the proposed approach on the quality of the generated CMs, such as their accuracy, completeness, and relevance.

Overall, the study provides a valuable contribution to the field of CMG by
