### Summary:
- The article introduces the concept of knowledge editing (KE) for large language models (LLMs) and addresses the problem of black-box LLMs editing. It proposes a multi-perspective evaluation framework and a novel postEdit framework to tackle privacy leaks and style over-editing. The architecture and methodology of postEdit, including the training of the post-editor and the inference process, are discussed.
- The process of inferring the post-edit for a user query is outlined, involving recalling the most similar edit from the edit memory and obtaining the input xedit by populating the editing template T edit. The ultimate output ye is determined based on the content of the edited response.
- The procedure of knowledge editing (KE) is discussed, along with the evaluation of different methods under varying memory sizes and efficiency considerations. Related work in knowledge editing and post-processing methods is also presented, along with a discussion on limitations and ethical considerations.
- The evaluation framework for knowledge editing is detailed, highlighting the results of Pearson correlation analyses between human scores and automated metrics. The necessity of incorporating both textual and semantic metrics in the evaluation process is emphasized, as well as the significance of a combined evaluation of editing and retention metrics.

### Major Findings:
1. Introduction of a multi-perspective evaluation framework and a novel postEdit framework to address limitations in black-box LLMs editing.
2. The process of inferring the post-edit for a user query and determining the ultimate output based on the content of the edited response.
3. The effectiveness of proposed metrics in evaluating knowledge editing and the significance of incorporating both textual and semantic dimensions in the evaluation process.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article provides valuable insights into knowledge editing methods, efficiency considerations, and ethical implications. However, further research is needed to address potential biases and limitations in the proposed frameworks. Additionally, the integration of multiple metrics for a more accurate assessment should be explored in future studies.
