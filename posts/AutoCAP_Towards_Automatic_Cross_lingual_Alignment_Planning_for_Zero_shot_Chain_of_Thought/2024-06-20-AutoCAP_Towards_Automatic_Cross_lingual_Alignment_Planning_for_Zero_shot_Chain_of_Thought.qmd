### Summary:
- The paper introduces an automatic cross-lingual alignment planning (AutoCAP) framework to address the challenges of manual language specification and static weight allocation in cross-lingual chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.
- AutoCAP consists of two key modules: (1) Automatic Language Selection Prompting and (2) Automatic Weight Allocation Prompting.
- Automatic Language Selection Prompting enables LLMs to automatically select the most accurately aligned languages for reasoning for each query.
- Automatic Weight Allocation Prompting is used for automatically allocating an alignment weight score to each language reasoning path.
- Experimental results on several benchmarks show that AutoCAP achieves superior performance compared to previous baselines, even surpassing previous manually selected language methods.

### Major Findings:
1. AutoCAP greatly alleviates the burden of manually selecting languages and weights.
2. The core of AutoCAP comprises Automatic Language Selection Prompting and Automatic Weight Allocation Prompting, which achieves to automatically select the most appropriate languages and weights for cross-lingual CoT.
3. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that AutoCAP surpassed the previous approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance and exhibiting strong generalizability.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The paper presents a novel approach to address the challenges of manual language specification and static weight allocation in cross-lingual CoT reasoning.
- The proposed AutoCAP framework effectively utilizes LLMs to automatically select the most appropriate languages and allocate weights for cross-lingual CoT.
- The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of AutoCAP compared to previous baselines, highlighting its strong generalizability.
- However, the paper does not discuss the limitations or potential biases of the proposed approach. It would be beneficial to include an analysis of the limitations and potential biases to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.
- Additionally, the paper does not provide a comparison with other recent approaches that address the same challenges in cross-lingual CoT reasoning. Including such a comparison would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.
