### **Summary:**
- The article proposes a method called POGER to improve the detection of AI-generated text (AIGT) under the black-box setting.
- The proposed method estimates word generation probabilities to empower black-box AIGT detection and shows its feasibility.
- POGER outperforms all baselines in macro F1 under black-box, partial white-box, and out-of-distribution settings.

### Major Findings:
1. POGER outperforms all baselines in macro F1 under black-box, partial white-box, and out-of-distribution settings.
2. The proposed method estimates word generation probabilities to empower black-box AIGT detection and shows its feasibility.
3. POGER maintains lower re-sampling costs than its existing counterparts.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The article provides a feasible solution to improve the detection of AI-generated text under the black-box setting.
- The proposed method, POGER, demonstrates superior performance in various settings, including black-box, partial white-box, and out-of-distribution scenarios.
- The article does not mention any limitations or potential biases in the proposed method, which could be a point of critique. It would be beneficial to address any potential shortcomings or areas for further research.
