### **Summary:**
The article proposes an approach to utilize chatbots as mediators of conversation and sources of limited and controlled generation of explanations to support students in understanding learning-paths recommendations. The proposed approach utilizes a knowledge graph (KG) as a human-curated source of information to regulate the output of large language models (LLMs) through defining its prompt’s context. The chatbot supports students in understanding learning recommendations and connects them with human mentors when necessary. The article evaluates the chatbot with a user study to provide a proof-of-concept and highlight potential requirements and limitations of utilizing chatbots in conversational explainability.

### Major Findings:
1. Student commitment towards a learning recommendation is not separable from their understanding of the reasons it was recommended to them and their ability to modify it based on that understanding.
2. The proposed LLM-based chatbot supports students in understanding learning-paths recommendations by utilizing a knowledge graph (KG) as a human-curated source of information to regulate the LLM’s output through defining its prompt’s context.
3. The chatbot plays a mediator role in connecting students with human mentors, either on demand or in cases that exceed the chatbot’s pre-defined tasks.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides a comprehensive approach to utilizing chatbots for conversational explainability in learning recommendations. However, the study has limitations, including a small sample size for the user study and a dependency on GPT-4. The article also highlights the need for further research to test the effect of the chatbot on students in a longer-term learning setting and to compare the results when using other LLMs. Additionally, the article emphasizes the importance of involving educators and domain experts in the design phase of the chatbot's prompt context and the final shape of the explanation.
