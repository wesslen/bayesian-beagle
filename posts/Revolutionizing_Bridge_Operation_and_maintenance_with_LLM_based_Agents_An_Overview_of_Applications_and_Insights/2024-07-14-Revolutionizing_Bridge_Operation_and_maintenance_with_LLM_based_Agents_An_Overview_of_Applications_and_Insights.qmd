### Summary:

The study explores the impact of AI bodies based on large-scale language models (LLMs) on the field of bridge operation and maintenance (O&M) and analyzes the potential challenges and opportunities they bring to the core tasks of bridge O&M. The authors aim to provide a comprehensive perspective for understanding the application of intelligentsia in this field. The paper discusses the evolution of bridge O&M management and AI body research, highlighting how AI body technology can inject new vitality into the bridge O&M field and drive industrial innovation.

### Major Findings:

1. The development of bridge maintenance systems has progressed through three main stages: paper-based document systems, more complete software systems, and intelligent systems utilizing BIM, ML, and DT technology.
2. The development of AI bodies has progressed through five major stages: symbolic agents, reactive agents, reinforcement learning-based agents, agents with transfer learning and meta-learning, and large language model-based agents.
3. LLM-based agents can realize autonomous perception, planning, decision-making, and action through natural language interaction, bringing new hope to the study of agents.

### Analysis and Critique:

The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of bridge O&M management and AI body research, highlighting the potential benefits and application potential of LLM-based agents in the field of bridge O&M. However, the paper does not discuss the limitations or challenges of implementing LLM-based agents in bridge O&M, such as the need for large-scale data and computational resources, the potential for bias in AI decision-making, and the need for ethical considerations in the development and deployment of AI systems. Additionally, the paper does not provide specific examples of how LLM-based agents have been or could be applied to bridge O&M tasks. Further research is needed to explore these issues and provide practical guidance for the implementation of LLM-based agents in bridge O&M.
