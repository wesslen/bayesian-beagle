**Summary:**

The paper introduces a new scheme, TF-Attack, for Transferable and Fast adversarial attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs). TF-Attack employs an external LLM as a third-party overseer to identify critical units within sentences, rather than the victim model. It also introduces the concept of Importance Level, which allows for parallel substitutions of attacks. The proposed method is evaluated on 6 widely adopted benchmarks, and results show that it consistently surpasses previous methods in transferability and delivers significant speed improvements, up to 20 times faster than earlier attack strategies.

**Major Findings:**

1. TF-Attack employs an external LLM as a third-party overseer to identify critical units within sentences, rather than the victim model.
2. TF-Attack introduces the concept of Importance Level, which allows for parallel substitutions of attacks.
3. TF-Attack consistently surpasses previous methods in transferability and delivers significant speed improvements, up to 20 times faster than earlier attack strategies.

**Analysis and Critique:**

1. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the core mechanisms of previous predominant adversarial attack methods, revealing their limitations in transferability and efficiency.
2. The proposed TF-Attack method addresses these limitations by employing an external LLM and introducing the concept of Importance Level.
3. The paper presents extensive experimental results on 6 widely adopted benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
4. However, the paper does not discuss potential countermeasures that could be developed to defend against TF-Attack.
5. The paper also does not discuss the potential ethical implications of using adversarial attacks on LLMs.
6. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and implications of the proposed method.
