### Summary of the Article:

The article investigates the ability of transformer-based models to learn structural recursion from examples, focusing on the programming language domain. It introduces a general framework to connect abstract concepts of structural recursion with concrete sequence modeling problems and the behaviors of learned models. The study identifies issues where the models trained to emulate recursive computations fail to capture the recursion fully, fitting short-cut algorithms instead. The research highlights the difficulty for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to mine recursive rules from in-context demonstrations and emulate step-wise computation of recursive functions.

### Major Findings:
1. Transformer-based models trained to emulate recursive computations cannot fully capture the recursion and instead fit short-cut algorithms.
2. State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) struggle to mine recursive rules from in-context demonstrations and to emulate the step-wise computation of recursive functions. 
3. The research introduces a general framework for representing and reasoning about structural recursion with sequence models, paving the path towards understanding how to better handle recursion with sequence models.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides a comprehensive investigation of the challenges and limitations faced by transformer-based models in learning to emulate structural recursion. The findings shed light on the inability of these models to fully capture the recursive behavior and instead resort to fitting short-cut algorithms. The identification of these issues offers valuable insights into the limitations of current transformer-based models in solving tasks involving structural recursion. However, the article could benefit from further exploration of potential solutions or alternative approaches to address these limitations. Additionally, it would be valuable to include a discussion on the implications of these findings for the field of sequence modeling and the development of more effective and reliable models for tasks involving recursion.
