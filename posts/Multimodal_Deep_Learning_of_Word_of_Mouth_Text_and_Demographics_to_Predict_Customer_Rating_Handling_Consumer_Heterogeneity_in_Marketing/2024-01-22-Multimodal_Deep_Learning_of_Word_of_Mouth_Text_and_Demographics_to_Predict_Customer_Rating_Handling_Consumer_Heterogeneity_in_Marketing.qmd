### **Summary:**
The study focuses on predicting customer ratings in marketing by using multimodal deep learning of word-of-mouth text and demographics to handle consumer heterogeneity. The authors construct a product evaluation model that takes into account consumer heterogeneity by multimodal learning of online product reviews and consumer profile information. They compare multiple models using different modalities or hyper-parameters to demonstrate the robustness of multimodal learning in marketing analysis.

### Major Findings:
1. Multimodal learning improves prediction accuracy, especially when combining review text and user profile data.
2. The scale of the BERT model does not necessarily contribute to an improvement in prediction accuracy, particularly in small datasets.
3. Multimodal learning improves generalization performance, with the highest accuracy for test data.

### Analysis and Critique:
The study provides valuable insights into the use of multimodal learning for predicting customer ratings in marketing. However, the authors should consider the potential endogeneity between variables and further improvements in accuracy using techniques such as dropout. Additionally, the study's methodology can be extended to purchase prediction models by incorporating more data, such as purchase history and demographics. Overall, the study contributes to the understanding of consumer heterogeneity and the development of prediction models in marketing analysis.
