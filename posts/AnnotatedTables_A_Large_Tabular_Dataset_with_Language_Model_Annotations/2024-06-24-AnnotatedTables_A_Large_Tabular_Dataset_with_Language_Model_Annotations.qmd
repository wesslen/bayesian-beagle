# Summary:

The paper introduces AnnotatedTables, a large-scale tabular dataset with annotations generated by large language models (LLMs). The authors address the bottleneck of labor-intensive human annotations by using LLMs to understand and annotate tabular data. The dataset is constructed from diverse cross-domain tabular data and includes 405,616 valid SQL programs, making it the largest SQL dataset with associated tabular data that supports query execution. The paper also presents two follow-up studies: 1) investigating LLMs' ability to translate SQL programs to Rel programs, a database language previously unknown to LLMs, and 2) evaluating the performance of TabPFN, a recent neural tabular classifier, on tables with input-target columns identified and annotated by LLMs. The results show that LLMs can automate the annotation of large volumes of diverse tabular data, and TabPFN performs on par with the baseline AutoML method, though the relative performance can vary significantly from one data table to another.

# Major Findings:

1. The paper introduces AnnotatedTables, a large-scale tabular dataset with LLM-generated annotations, addressing the bottleneck of labor-intensive human annotations.
2. The dataset includes 405,616 valid SQL programs, making it the largest SQL dataset with associated tabular data that supports query execution.
3. The paper presents two follow-up studies: 1) LLMs' ability to translate SQL programs to Rel programs with adequate accuracy using Incremental Prompt Engineering, and 2) the performance of TabPFN on a wide variety of tabular classification problems.

# Analysis and Critique:

The paper presents a novel approach to annotating large-scale tabular datasets using LLMs, which has the potential to significantly reduce the time and resources required for data annotation. The introduction of AnnotatedTables as a large-scale tabular dataset with LLM-generated annotations is a valuable contribution to the field. However, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the quality and reliability of the LLM-generated annotations, as well as a comparison with human-generated annotations. Additionally, the paper could explore the potential limitations and biases of using LLMs for
