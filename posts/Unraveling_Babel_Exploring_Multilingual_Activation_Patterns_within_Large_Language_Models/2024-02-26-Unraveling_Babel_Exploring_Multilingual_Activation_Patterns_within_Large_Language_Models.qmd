### **Summary:**
- Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in language processing, but their mechanisms for processing multiple languages are not well understood.
- This study explores the multilingual activation patterns of LLMs by transforming them into a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture and analyzing expert activation patterns when processing various languages.
- The findings reveal the existence of non-language-specific neurons and language-specific activation neurons, as well as the potential to accelerate inference using high-frequency activation neurons.

### **Major Findings:**
1. LLMs exhibit distinct activation patterns when processing different languages.
2. Activation patterns across different languages are connected at the level of language families.
3. The study identifies non-language-specific neurons and language-specific activation neurons within LLMs.

### **Analysis and Critique:**
- The study is limited to the Llama 2 model and nine common languages, which may not fully represent the multilingual capabilities of LLMs.
- The potential biases in the study's findings should be considered, as the results may not be generalizable to all LLMs and languages.
- Further research is needed to explore the implications of these findings for multilingual training and model pruning of LLMs, as well as to extend the experiments to a broader array of models and languages.
