**Summary:**

The article focuses on addressing the inadequacy of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning with symbols and non-natural language textual representations. The proposed symbol-to-language (S2L) method aims to enable LLMs to solve symbol-related problems by converting symbols into language-based representations and integrating them into the original problem. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the S2L method across eight symbol-related tasks using various LLM models.

### Major Findings:
1. **Inadequacy of LLMs in Reasoning with Symbols:**
   - Large language models exhibit limited performance in reasoning with symbols compared to general natural language tasks.
   - Existing LLMs struggle with symbol-related problems due to underrepresentation of symbols in their training corpus and subpar understanding of symbol-based representations.

2. **S2L Method for Solving Symbol-Related Problems:**
   - S2L converts symbols to language-based representations using LLMs or external tools.
   - The language-based representations are integrated into the original problem through direct substitution or concatenation, leading to consistent and significant improvements in LLM performance across different tasks.

3. **Application Across Varied Symbol-Related Tasks:**
   - The S2L method is applied to diverse tasks such as abstract reasoning, Dyck language, chemical property prediction, emotion analysis of emojis, table question-answering, and sentiment analysis in social media.
   - Experimental results show the efficacy of S2L in improving LLM performance in solving symbol-related problems, thereby expanding the potential applicability of LLMs in a broader range of scenarios.

### Analysis and Critique:
The article provides valuable insights into the limitations of LLMs in handling symbol-related problems and offers a potential solution through the S2L method. However, the generalization of S2L across different models and tasks presents a promising outlook. Despite the successes demonstrated in the experimental results, the article does not extensively address the limitations of the S2L method, such as the difficulty in converting all non-natural language representations into language-based equivalents and the potential generation of incorrect descriptions by LLMs. Further research and analysis are required to explore the applicability of S2L in more complex scenarios and evaluate its limitations. Moreover, the methodological challenges and potential biases associated with the S2L method would benefit from a more comprehensive discussion.
