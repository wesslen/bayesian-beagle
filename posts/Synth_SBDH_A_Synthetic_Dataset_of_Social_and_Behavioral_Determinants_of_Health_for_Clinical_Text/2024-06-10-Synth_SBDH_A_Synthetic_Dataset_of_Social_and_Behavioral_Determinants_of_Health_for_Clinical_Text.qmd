**Summary:**

The study introduces Synth-SBDH, a novel synthetic dataset with detailed SBDH annotations, encompassing status, temporal information, and rationale across 15 SBDH categories. The dataset is the largest publicly available SBDH dataset and is generated and annotated by an LLM (GPT-4). The utility of Synth-SBDH is showcased on three tasks using real-world clinical datasets from two distinct hospital settings, highlighting its versatility, generalizability, and distillation capabilities. Models trained on Synth-SBDH consistently outperform counterparts with no Synth-SBDH training, achieving up to 62.5% macro-F improvements. Synth-SBDH proves effective for rare SBDH categories and under-resource constraints. Human evaluation demonstrates a Human-LLM alignment of 71.06% and uncovers areas for future refinements.

**Major Findings:**

1. Synth-SBDH is the largest publicly available SBDH dataset, comprising 8,767 examples generated and annotated by GPT-4 with detailed SBDH information, encompassing various dimensions such as presence, temporality, and rationale across 15 meticulously chosen SBDH categories.
2. Models with different architectural backbones, when trained on Synth-SBDH, exhibit substantial improvements over counterparts without Synth-SBDH training on real-world clinical datasets. For instance, Synth-SBDH yields performance gains of up to 62.36% in SBDH detection as a multi-label classification task.
3. Synth-SBDH significantly improves the performance for rare SBDH categories on out-of-domain real-world clinical datasets, with up to 93.59 absolute F-score improvements. Synth-SBDH is also useful in low-resource (data and compute) settings.

**Analysis and Critique:**

The study presents a novel synthetic dataset, Synth-SBDH, which addresses the limitations of existing SBDH datasets and leverages the potential of LLMs in healthcare. The dataset is comprehensive, covering a wide range of SBDH categories and providing detailed
