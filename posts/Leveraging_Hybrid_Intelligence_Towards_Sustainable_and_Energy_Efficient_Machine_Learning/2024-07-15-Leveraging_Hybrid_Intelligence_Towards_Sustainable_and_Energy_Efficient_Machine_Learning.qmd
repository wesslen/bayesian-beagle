### Summary:
- The paper presents an approach to leverage Hybrid Intelligence towards sustainable and energy-aware machine learning.
- The authors aim to enhance resource efficiency and significantly reduce energy consumption by incorporating HITL systems and LLMs as smart agent assistance.
- The integration of Hybrid Intelligence support into machine learning workflows represents a promising solution to existing challenges, leading to more effective and environmentally responsible practices.
- The authors propose integrating energy awareness directly into the training loop by using sensors to confirm deviations in energy usage and provide accurate measurements of the full system.
- The final outcome of this work targets to integrate the Hybrid Intelligence and the energy awareness approaches into a robust framework that connects all components seamlessly.

### Major Findings:
1. Hybrid Intelligence can significantly improve the sustainability and effectiveness of ubiquitous applications, addressing the various challenges from data, models, and hardware.
2. The integration of energy awareness directly into the training loop can provide accurate measurements of the full system and ensure that models are trained with energy efficiency in mind.
3. The proposed framework aims to connect all components seamlessly, allowing for user interaction, tracking resource usage, and providing a user-friendly frontend tool.

### Analysis and Critique:
- The paper presents a promising approach to leverage Hybrid Intelligence and energy awareness for sustainable and energy-efficient machine learning.
- However, the proposed framework is still in the conceptualization phase and requires in-depth investigation through future work.
- The authors acknowledge the challenges in selecting the right visualization, especially when lossy dimension reduction strategies are applied and information content is missing.
- The paper does not provide a detailed evaluation of the proposed framework, which is essential to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the sustainability and performance of machine learning models.
- The authors could have provided more details on the potential limitations and uncertainties of the proposed approach, such as the impact of missing information content in dimension reduction techniques and the challenges in integrating energy awareness into the training loop.
