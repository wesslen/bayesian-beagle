The article presents a study on the game One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW), a variant of the famous communication game Werewolf. The authors explore the importance of discussion tactics in the game and propose an RL-instructed language agent framework to enhance the discussion ability of LLM-based agents. The framework leverages a policy optimized by reinforcement learning (RL) to determine an appropriate discussion tactic. The authors conduct experiments in a three-player and a five-player ONUW game to evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of their proposed framework. The results indicate that the integration of the discussion policy can help LLM-based agents approximate Perfect Bayesian Equilibria (PBEs) more closely and improve the performance of LLM-based agents. The authors also observe that the discussion policy trained by RL performs better than that by directly prompting LLM. The article contributes to the understanding of the role of discussion in the ONUW game and provides a novel approach to enhancing the discussion ability of LLM-based agents.
